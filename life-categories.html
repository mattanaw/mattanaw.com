<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p><em>Created Monday, June 20<sup>th</sup>, 2022</em>, <time>10:31 AM
Alaska Time</time></p>
<p>This page is a development off of the earlier project which was
undertaken for several years called, unloftily, the “Personal Form”. The
objective of the personal form was to arrange materials that served the
purpose of guiding life on a daily bases, creating organization, and
providing a means of intaking data to track activities.</p>
<p>Here is a page with scans and evolution of the original <a
href="mattanaws-personal-form.html">Personal Form</a>.</p>
<p>The personal form was intended to provide a daily method akin to what
might one day be provided by technology, but was not provided at the
time and is not provided today. A fundamental objective of the form was
to have a way of keeping track of key ingredients of a good life plan,
tailored individually. While there are devices today that try to record
and keep some information on your behalf, none do it in a comprehensive
way or in a way that is really feasible for your best mental
development. If you were to train yourself by taking on the task of
collecting and recording your own information you could use a paper form
like this one, or else you could use a digital form or a digital
spreadsheet. At the time of the creation of my personal form, there was
no good means of digitally inputting the information. Later with the
advent of online spreadsheets like Google Docs/Sheets, it was found that
the technology was still inadequate for the task for a variety of
reasons which can be later shared. Online forms associated with
spreadsheets, or other forms, were also suboptimal by comparison to a
simplel paper form. I spent a considerable amount of time thinking about
how I could convert the paper based form to an online form and found
that the paper form was simply superior to an online form, and it
appears this is still true today.</p>
<p>With this section I am resuming the development of this personal form
which I stopped working on nearly 10 years ago.</p>
<p>I will resume collecting information using the same paper-based
method as before, but using a modified form tailored to my current
needs, since they are dramatically different from my needs before.</p>
<p><a name="categories-and-priorities-in-the-form"></a></p>
<h3 id="categories-and-priorities-in-the-form.">Categories and
Priorities in the Form.</h3>
<p>The Form included a number of categories which served to focus
attention on those aspects of life that are necessary for ensuring that
nothing serious is omitted from plans and activities for a long period
of time.</p>
<p>For example, one may be especially interested for a period in money
until one’s livelihood reaches a certain level of stability. During that
time, money would be a primary category of attention and would, perhaps,
have a higher position in the form for greater attention, and more time
would be spent reviewing and refreshing on goals that relate to money,
and also on recording information relating to daily transactions or
financial planning. Working on this priority it is assured that time and
energy would be taken away from other categories. Each of the categories
I included were those I thought were important to me for having a high
quality life, and high quality self-training; however, it is and was not
possible to continue recording on each topic. Recording and focusing on
any individual topic takes a considerable amount of time. Taking it for
one priority removes time for the others. Certainly, one does not want
to spend too much time with a form such as this. One finding I had in
this process is that one really does have a very limited amount of
attention for guiding any aspect of one’s life. One has to focus on the
most important items, keep the others somewhat in awareness, and admit
that one cannot make improvements globally over time. There has to be
sufficient focus on specific categories of personal importance,
prioritized temporarily over others, until certain accomplishments are
achieved.</p>
<p>To give another example. I was very overweight when I started the
form. Accounting for my nutrition and calories, and my exercise was of
great importance. However, over time I trained myself to not really
require the form any longer to maintain my weight and my fitness. I
could have improved my fitness further, but instead, I realizedI should
focus my attention on other things, having already trained myself to
automatically do what I needed to do about my weight, eating habits, and
fitness. Today my weight is in a reasonable range and I’m very good at
keeping my fitness in a good place. However, I have let certain things
slide which require more attention, and so today my priorities using
these same categories would be different than they were formerly.</p>
<p>The categories in the form can be altered depending on who is using
the form. It is possible that categories could be combined, some
omitted, and some others included. However, I have found that these
categories, after much development, are comprehensive. They do seem to
exhaustively cover what a good life consists of, at least in my life.
There is nothing that I would want to record that would not have a
category already existing for it. One can categorize and re-categorize
many times without much benefit. This organization really is adequate
for the task of prioritizing my life and making sure all is covered and
nothing too important has been omitted. When I say “all is covered” I
don’t mean that all is given equal attention, or much attention at all.
Rather, I mean to say, nothing is totally forgotten that could be of
importance. If you observe people who act as mentors in your life who
are really good at what they do, you’ll see they will scan for what you
might be missing that is of importance. Living in a good family as a
child, one would have most parts of life covered without much attention
or thought about it. Others are looking after you and may notice if
suddenly you are not active or are not eating well, or are excessively
isolated and not spending time with friends. However, when you are
alone, only you are attentive to what you are doing, and it is much
easier to let certain things deteriorate, while certain other parts of
life are in focus.</p>
<p>The purpose of the form, and the life categories and priorities, is
to keep important parts of life in view at the least, and to focus your
efforts and attention to those areas that are important for the
moment.</p>
<p>This section will contain developments on this idea and reflections
on what is involved in following such a process, and ways to improve and
develop the process.</p>
<h3 id="im-the-example-here.">I’m the Example Here.</h3>
<p>This website has limited interest to others except when I share
particular articles to particular audiences. I.e. as a personal website,
I cannot expect a large readership. There is much to pay attention to
online and in the media, and I don’t know anyone who routinely reads of
anyone’s web page or blog specifically. I think mostly personal websites
and blogs are disappointments to those who write them, who hope for
better reactions and more reading attention. I anticipated this in a
writing I prepared that is also related to this, called <a
href="rational-times.html">Rational Times</a>. Rational times is like
the personal form in that the goal was to record and read writings
prepared by the self that were in times of special rationality, versus
other times when there is less clarity, ingenuity, or rationality in
behavior. People are good guides for themselves when they are in the
right mentality, and can benefit later from that same mentality if they
left themselves recordings. In any case, I wrote about how I did not
expect that others would read my writing. I think most who write
understand that firstly the use has to be for oneself, because if others
are not interested, the motivation for continuing or using what one has
written has to involve personal self-interest and enjoyment. If others
find it of interest then that is excellent, and perhaps there is a way
to earn money from the activity, but that is secondary. I anticipated
that in my life people would not read my writing, for a variety of
reasons. This website became a confirmation of this expectation. I don’t
think anyone will dwell on my website and read much of what I wrote. I
do think chunks of the site will have interest to people after I put it
in front of them online or in person. But the attention of others is
very limited, except for themselves and their already existing
interests, which might mean doing what I’m doing:</p>
<p>Ignoring most of what goes on that others create, but creating much
on my own that is to my own benefit.</p>
<p>And with that it is clear that I’m also not paying too much
attentnion to the writings of others. Rather, I found writings of
certain people and gave them considerable attention, but very little
attention to others in my environment who have blogs or other materials
to share. I would look, but not for too long.</p>
<p>On this website I’m experimenting on myself. I’m transparently
sharing my own personal developments. I <em>use</em> my own website. In
addition to the personal form, on paper, I will use these sections for
my own inspiration and training. Anyone who is interested may use these
pages also, of course, but I am not making specific recommendations here
for anyone, although I do make comments about what appears to be
generally applicable.</p>
<p>This portion of the site on life-categories and priorities has been
in development since 2006. While I discontinued use of the personal
form, I continued to use the concepts here in many diverse ways
penetrating other parts of my life. It has certainly permeated much of
what I do. It has also influenced my career as a technologist and
consultant, and has figured into my way of organizing my thinking, and
my software which organizes all of my digital possessions. This website
is a culmination of the use of the personal form with respect to
personal organization. I would want readers to understand that this site
and section is not something that is simply written with little
experience without good results. My life has been very fruitful in large
measure because of these efforts that I’ve taken, and my mind is not the
same mind as a result. I think others would benefit from the
considerations I included here, but again, to use my motto I had written
in my paper copy of Rational Times:</p>
<p>“Insofar as we are similar, we are similar; Insofar as we are
different we are different.” – used to the effect that advice to myself
may work for you if you are similar to me in the respects to which the
advice applies.</p>
<p>I’m not the same now as I was then, so even some advice then, is
inapplicable now, for the same person.</p>
<p>This site may, at this time, be considered a somewhat masterful
self-application. The system is still in development too so there’s much
to learn still, that I will focus on applying to myself. My objective
here is not to apply it to others or create expectations for others.
This is really about self-support and personal development.</p>

<p><em>[Update: Saturday, July 9<sup>th</sup>, 2022. After subsequent
review of the prior section it was determined that minor errors and
typos can remain permanently, which means this 38 minute portion of time
was adequate to forever complete this writing. No editing at all was
required, and this means the flow from the mind was of the mind of the
time, and no changes to that output are reasonable for losing the
information as to that state of mind. If you want to know a mind well it
is beneficial that those minds leave you unedited thoughts, excluding of
course, any self-corrections which happen spontaneously along the short
duration of recording or conversing.]</em></p>

<h3 id="size-of-the-form">Size of the Form</h3>
<p>The size of the form is an interesting thing for consideration which
would involve differences of opinion as to what is individually
effective. Again, I have to focus on what I found desirable and useful,
and share what seems different from the beginning to what I experienced
later, since not all developments are permanent improvements!</p>
<p>I start with writing on quarter pages that were hand cut from
inexpensive printer paper. That method today still seems very desirable.
A major reason for having the form on a single sheet of paper is to make
it feel as though very little is carried along during the day, and that
there is no issue having the paper moment to moment, in a pocket or
other. Being small, it hardly takes and space, creates any discomfort,
or has any noticable weight. You can keep it in the pocket as a male and
not feel annoyed by having too many things touching the legs, or
changing appearance of the pants. One can put one’s hands in the pockets
and not be too annoyed by the feel. The feel of the paper is also in
your control. Smaller unfolded sheets seem somehwat better than full
sheets folded, although I’ve found both are adequate. I’ve also carried
both in my small hiking bag that I used to carry everywhere. I kept it
in the same spot for years. In a small pocket on the most accessible
zipper-sealed part of the bag. It can be dropped in a purse or other bag
with a similar effect.</p>
<p>The small sheet doesn’t require folding and unfolding, or at least as
much. Recording on a smaller page is easy. Having one page and few
others is a livable solution. I would transfer some data from a prior
day into the later day, I recall, which meant for me, I would sometime
carry a prior days form. With my bag, I recall having a collection of
forms. One does have to have a place to put the forms later. Or they
could be discarded. Fortunately I kept most of my forms to be able to
archive, and scan and share here. But some forms were lost, without much
care. These were loose forms I didn’t have a place to put immediately
for archiving. I would stick them in my bag and a few would build up.
There are a number of ways they can be easily aggregated, but this is
not the place for a full conversation on archiving. For now I simply
want to mention that I did carry more than one form at a time,
sometimes. But for making sure that it is an easy task to record, and
self-remind, the single page, and the quarter page, are very effective
and don’t become uncomfortable. But you do have to think about what to
do with forms already completed from prior days.</p>
<p>The size of the form impacts how much can be written and reminded. An
obvious difference between the first and last forms was the level of
detail I was interested in. That greater level of detail was very useful
later, but initially to form a habit, and before what details were known
to be wanting, the smaller form is preferable. Today after knowing what
details I no longer care about, and what seems more vital for each
category to remind about and record, I am more interested in a simpler
form again. I could return to a quarter page. To keep things simple, and
to develop off the last form, I have started again with a full page form
with all printed on one side. When I was using the quarter page forms I
would write on each side for one single day. I will be updating the
version of the form I’m using here <a
href="http://mattanaw.org/text-personal-form.html">Text</a><a
href="http://mattanaw.org/text-personal-form.pdf">PDF</a>. These forms
are hilariously simple by comparison to my end result after all my years
of doing the earlier form. I think it will be further reduced in size,
but expanded on reminders about key factors and areas of interest. This
is being redeveloped, and as I think about it, I’m kinda going through
the same steps I started out going through, but with much more maturity
as far as what I’ve internalized through training throughout the years.
So the form is similar, but my mind and behavior are very different.
This, I think, is meaningful in that the simple form really can be of
lifelong utility, without a huge alteration in approach.</p>
<p>The simple single page form results in less of a feeling of spending
too much time on the task, of writing and reading, and reminding. Later
as I was recording much more information, I was doing much more reading
and recording into the form. The longer form, even if it didn’t have an
incredible amount written into it, may have taken more than an hour of
time. This may seem shocking but it really is the case that not much can
really be accomplished in an hours time with all the various categories
on the longer form. But wanting my mind to be <em>aware</em> of each and
every category, and not only writing about all categories, I wanted the
larger form. I wanted better sophisitcation in certain areas and that
really did benefit me, even if it appears, from looking at the forms,
not much was written.</p>
<p><em>You can think about what your plans are with the form without
writing anything in the form ever.</em></p>
<p>Doing such a thing though would lead one to wonder about social
criticisms. You carry that form but you don’t write much? Many other
sorts of criticisms may arise in the mind even without the existence of
any conversation with others. I suggest ignoring any attempts at
self-criticism on social grounds. Reminding oneself of something
important for years until necessary growth steps occur is basic
learning. Really some milestones will be due to the discipline, and
certain steps might not occur for months or years. But when those steps
really are taken, the results might last for one’s entire life, or for a
very long period of time. Ideas occur which would not otherwise result.
It’s very nice to have an idea that sticks and is useful, even if it
wasn’t recorded at all.</p>
<p>If everything from the simple form, or the larger form were recorded
into a digital system, it would be found that the data entry work to do
it would be a job. Notice that I have not taken the time to
<em>extract</em> all the data from the older forms to input them into
spreadsheets or into a database system. As a software architect this is
something I can surely do. I’ve even guided massive organizations on
their “paperless transformation journeys” which had objectives of moving
from paper forms to digital forms, and digital systems of storage. For
myself, knowing about these technologies, and what is required, and what
the end result is, I know that extracting the data is not particularly
useful, apart from scanning.</p>
<p>Suppose one had a real scientific interest, and one is able to in
advance plan data such that experimental design requirements of
statistical significance are achieved. In that case, moving the data
into a digital format for analysis, using programs or other, would be
useful. But I didn’t do that! I can hardly expect anyone else could if I
didn’t. However, if one is really good at such a thing, and such an
interest exists, one could science one’s own life using real
experimentation.</p>
<p>This work still is of scientific import, but does not have the rigor
of such an approach mentioned above, such that it would be readily
accepted into a peer reviewed journal, chunked into a group of studies.
I knew this would not really be feasible for me along the way too, and
being a moralist, have other ideas about how to obtain useful general
information, which is amenable to science but is not as rigorous as what
scientists themselves expect, having been exposed to work of earlier
scientists. And of course, I am trained in the sciences, am myself a
scientist in my own estimation. But I have not converted this or planned
this to be a work of science as much as a work of personal morality, and
a general purpose personal moral system would require conclusions of
thousands of papers, and there is not enough time for that.</p>
<p>So I have opted to record and archive, to make observations about my
prior experiences and what I’ve created, and use it for my future
development, and retain it for sharing my life and autobiography, and my
moral system.</p>
<p>It would be hard to extract this data. If put in a table I don’t
think one would search the tables often. I think the reflections lead to
“next steps” in life and not a search for meaning about what one has
already done. The data entry work would be now, looking at all the forms
I made, a real job. One that might take a person several months if not a
year to complete. The system design would not anticipate the use
requirements later.</p>
<p>What does all this mean for anyone inputting the information?</p>
<p>What I’m getting at is that a paper form like this is really still
too complex, right now, for any software implementation too. I noted
above, that there is no system that can mine your life and record the
key pieces of information about you in a way that is useful to you, and
more useful to you than this form. You’d have to have sensors on you,
and multiple computing devices, from the same manufacturer, or
manufacturers in cooperation, to merge the data into a single result.
But you can simply function as a human being with a pen and paper and do
it all yourself in a way that technoglogy still cannot do!</p>
<p>So in conclusion for now, what I wish to convey is that a simple
single page personal form is really livable in its utility. It can
provide a chance to retain autobiographical information. It is also
better in terms of how information is aggregated than any single digital
system in use today. And this is despite the existence of Apple Watches,
Fitbits, Google Docs spreadsheets, and any Smartphone. These tools are
sophisticated but come nowhere close to fulfilling what a simple paper
form can fulfill.</p>
<p>I think this is a somewhat conclusive statement, at least for present
day 2022, given my personal background in technology too, very advanced
in my career.</p>
