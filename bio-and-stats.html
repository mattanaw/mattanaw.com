<p><strong><em>Invitation to EPGSIG and Prompting of this
Bio.</em></strong></p>
<p>I wrote the biographical sketch below upon being invited into EPGSIG
by Mr. Roddy Young, and being nudged once by Mr. Mark Siegmund to
complete the task of filling my application. Without knowing the
standard format, I’ve taken the liberty to skip chronology to simplify
the effort. I am happy to make changes to more closely approximate those
prepared by other members of the group, if that is desired or
required.</p>
<p><strong><em>Notes on some unusual early traits.</em></strong></p>
<p>I’ve always been very talented physically, quickly grasping and
repeating movements I’ve seen with little effort, and performing well in
any sports I seriously attempted, probably being due to being able to
visual activities completely in advance of performing them. As an adult,
I learned how to juggle simply by first observing someone juggling. I
believe I had this ability early in youth, enabling me to skip crawling
and begin walking, at 7 months old, a favorite story my mother would
tell me as I was growing up. On day I just “got it” and began walking,
despite having been born with bowed legs, that awkwardly stepped over
top each other. This deformity gradually worked itself out without
intervention, and ever since I was very skilled athletically, and
consistently performed at the top of my class, including having the most
first place awards during field day in middle school.</p>
<p>I was also excellent with math as far back as I can remember. At 2
years and 9 months, while waiting for my brother to be born in the
hospital, I recall insisting to an older boy that counting into the
larger numbers, at one million and beyond, was impossible. I also was
gifted in music, being able to recall in detail various pieces of
classical music, being able to whistle along or at other times from
memory. While still in elementary school, I took on study of the Oboe
and wrote a composition in 64<sup>th</sup> and 128<sup>th</sup> notes,
inspired by the concertos written by Vivaldi.</p>
<p>I always had exceptionally powerful visuospatial, pattern
recognition, and verbal communication abilities, although in my early
upbringing, I eventually left academic pursuits to focus more on my
interests in the outdoors and athletics, and became gradually
disillusioned and disinterested in school, until I started college.</p>
<p><strong><em>Finding Others.</em></strong></p>
<p>Throughout my life I’ve had significant trouble finding people with
similar affinities and communication abilities. In retrospect, friends
and adults listened but did not seem to comprehend. Due to politeness,
and respect for my peers, and family, I have failed to truly acknowledge
the extent of my giftedness until later in my adulthood, although I was
always aware, that nobody I ever spoke with brought me complete personal
satisfaction. I failed to achieve “communion” with anyone I ever spoke
with. All conversation, in retrospect, appears to have been mostly
superficial, and for much of my childhood, I covered this over, by
enjoying humor and jovial friendships, that did not have as much depth
as I would have liked.</p>
<p>After a long period of time mostly focusing on myself and my studies
(partly as a coping mechanism), my career, and my wife whom I met while
still in high school, I began to desire heightened communication, which
was lacking for so many years. In order to achieve that I joined Mensa.
I was initially disappointed, finding the level of communication to be,
at first, quite low, instead gravitating to higher ceiling groups—or
groups including members of these groups—like HighIQWorld, which I found
especially pleasant. In this group I found others who seemed more
like-minded, who apparently were also in the higher ceilinged groups,
including Prometheus, Mega, and others. Like myself, these friends were
kind, polite, highly creative and critical in thinking, had an
understanding of logic, and the interdisciplinary nature of almost all
topics and problems of interest. They seemed to acknowledge my
uniqueness in a way that was never completely validated until I met
them; although in my career in software, I was already being called
“brilliant”, a “genius”, and even a “legend”, from colleagues advanced
in their fields. I value their comments highly, and to some extent I
feel embarrassed even to mention that this is what they said, not
feeling entirely deserving of such praise or appreciation. As I began to
experience some similar feedback from friends in the intelligence
societies, I was finally able to internalize my confirmation with
finality, although I am still quite motivated to find others who will
provide ever more satisfying connections. This is a reason why I am
welcoming of an invitation to join Mensa’s EPGSIG.</p>
<p><strong><em>My Career</em></strong></p>
<p>Professionally, I am a former software architect working for large
enterprises, such as Adobe Systems, where I was Chief Architect, and
Partner Solution Consultant (A similar title to that of Edward Snowden),
representing North America, excluding Latin America. I now own my own
company, Social Architects and Economists INTL, and focus on guiding
companies in their digital transformation projects internationally. I’ve
worked in a variety of industries, including Federal Government, State
and Local Governments, the Government of Canada, and the White House.
I’ve worked in the media and entertainment industries, telecom, higher
education, financial industry, and currently I’m contracted for work
guiding two large Pharmaceutical companies, with great fortune, due to
the current Coronavirus Pandemic.</p>
<p>Despite having been a “late bloomer” to an extent in my academic and
career pursuits, I have already attained a level of advancement I’m not
sure I can eclipse, except in doing business for myself. I can say I am
mostly validated and maybe I can claim “self-actualization” even with
respect to my career, since it has already gone quite beyond my
expectations.</p>

profile here: <a

<p><strong><em>My Education</em></strong></p>
<p>I have a B.S in Psychology, a B.S. in Computer and information
Science, and I nearly completed a 3rd. B.S in Philosophy, all within the
University of Maryland System. I and am now completing a master’s degree
at Harvard University, for Business and Economics, primarily to expand
upon my business and to validate some credential requirements, which I
feel exist, for being taken seriously in publication. I have a book in
progress about my experiences developing land here in Alaska, and my
experiences in local politics in Anchorage.</p>
<p>While I’m quite experienced in technology, and have an eclectic
education, I would consider my greatest area of sophistication to be in
my moral understanding. I have been planning to complete a work of
ethics that I started roughly two decades ago. I expect this will be my
second book that I will be able to start upon completing my first book
I’ve already been “green lit” for completing with my publisher.</p>
<p>Despite being fairly well educated, I have always considered myself
an autodidact, having had at one point a library of approximately 1,600
volumes. I am an interdisciplinarian and have been, for a long time,
resentful of any divisions in education, knowledge, and politics, (or
nation), and find myself preferring “situation first” or “problem first”
evaluation of almost any scenario of interest.</p>
<p><strong><em>History with Psychometrics</em></strong></p>
<p>I was first identified as gifted early in youth, around the second
grade, using an unidentified proctored intelligence exam standardized
for the State of Maryland. As a result of this test, I was qualified for
Mensa, and placed permanently in the Gifted and Talented program for my
school system (although I was verified again around seventh grade) and
remained in that program for the duration of my primary and secondary
school education. I was also given the opportunity to join various
“magnet schools” in my state, and to become involved in Johns Hopkins
University’s Center for Talented Youth. These programs are now
recognized for some very influential alumni, such as Google’s co-founder
Sergei Brin, Facebook’s founder Mark Zuckerberg, and Lady Gaga.
Inexplicably my parents did not wish to include me in these programs,
although they did give reasons relating to the travel and financial
commitments required, although in retrospect, these do not appear to
have been the true reasons given other conversations. In their defense,
they did provide me access to various athletic programs in the local
boys and girls clubs <a
href="https://www.bgca.org">https://www.bgca.org</a>, but again, they
did not permit me to join the select leagues when scouts showed
interest, again citing the financial and travel requirements. I
therefore had many opportunities provided that I was hindered from
experiencing. However, I had quite a wonderful childhood with my
siblings and my friends, growing up in the outer suburbs of the
metropolitan D.C., in a beautiful setting. I can recall many experiences
enjoying the outdoors and athletics in my immediate neighborhood,
visiting many sites in the area, including the Smithsonian and other
areas rich with art and history, so it is difficult to not acknowledge
being very fortunate in a number of ways, and to recognize that everyone
has missed opportunities.</p>
<p>I did not think much about Mensa again until I was over 30 years old,
although at several moments in my adult life others have suggested that
I join, recognizing my diverse talents. I didn’t think much of the
suggestion until, however, I had two important experiences, around the
same time. Firstly, my wife began reading the book <em>Outliers</em> and
noted some similarities between myself and Christopher Langan. In this
book, there was a matrix reasoning problem that was presented as being
of great difficulty. My wife shared with me, and after a short time
staring at the puzzle, without much difficulty, I identified the correct
answer. There were 8 answers to choose from, but I was confident I
answered correctly without any luck, being able to discern the reason
for the answer. Knowing this was not an official test, I became quite
curious again what I could score if I were to take a new proctored exam.
I had a background in psychology, so I was aware of the tests
available.</p>
<p>About this time, I also became extremely successful as a software
architect, and became frustratingly aware of some insurmountable
communication disparities between myself and my colleagues, who were
also quite intelligent. I decided to retest. I verified my hunch with
the WAIS-IV and the Stanford-Binet V. Interestingly, I achieved ceiling
scores in a number of areas both visuospatial and verbal, but most
notably, on pattern recognition, seemingly verifying my correct answer
to the problem in <em>Outliers</em>, which supposedly a problem at the
ceiling of an extended range test. Confessedly, I do not currently have
a copy of <em>Outliers</em> handy, so cannot confirm, as I write this,
exactly what that problem’s source was.</p>
<p>I think there is one additional consideration of special interest.
I’ve commented elsewhere that being myself seems to create a kind of awe
and terror, particularly in my interactions in person, in real life. I
didn’t completely realize until I was running meetings with rooms full
of intelligent people, giving presentations or doing interviews while
simultaneously transcribing communications in my computer in a terminal
window. Apparently, asking people questions indicating full
understanding of nearly all they do, running a complex agenda, and
typing over 100 words a minute without making corrections is frightening
to others. This and similar occurrences are part of the reason why I
have received the praise in my occupation that I have.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, while transitioning to this more open mode of thinking
with friends, I have had some violently negative reactions, and instead
have to reduce myself to a degree to be pleasant while in their company,
both in person and while speaking to them in writing online. Again, this
makes it important to have some to talk with others of a similar
disposition.</p>
<p><strong><em>Other Interests</em></strong></p>
<p>In my free time, I’m busy with a wide variety of hobbies, projects,
and interests, as might be expected. I’m interested in athletics,
particularly weightlifting, running, hiking, and basketball. I’ve always
been athletically talented and driven. I am also a solo pilot, working
on my PPL for single engine tricyclic aircraft, and have 104 hours of
flight. I’m a self-represented attorney for a case of historical
interest here in Anchorage, regarding a prescriptive easement claim for
a trail across my 80-acre parcel, to the large and beautiful Chugach
State Park. I’ve been sporadically interested in land development,
surveying, foraging, and cabin building, which I hope to perform by hand
if I can sustain the motivation to do so.</p>
<p>I’ve been an avid traveler, with some 600,000 miles spent driving,
doing numerous cross-country road trips, and around one million miles
flying. I’ve been to South America, Europe, Africa, Asia, South America
and Australasia, and have been expectedly improved by these experiences.
I speak some Korean and Spanish, and have some training in Latin. I’m
interested in languages but primarily out of respect for communication
with others as opportunities arise.</p>
<p>This bio does not do complete justice to my range of interests and
projects, that punctuate my already busy schedule, but I think that is
likely the same for most members of this group, and so I happily accept
my invitation to join, to hopefully enrich the group, and benefit from
additional friendship opportunities.</p>
