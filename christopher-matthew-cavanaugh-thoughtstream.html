<p><em>[Edit: November, 28<sup>th</sup>, 2022. This is a note on what
the thoughtstream was about originally. It did not explain everything
that it was but provided brief clarification.] A recent note added
September 2<sup>nd</sup>, 2019, to my <a
href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/mattanaw">LinkedIn page</a>, that might
provide some clarity on what the ThoughtStream, and this larger website,
is and is not about.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>ThoughtStream</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A self-published, ongoing, artistic work of philosophy, ethics, and
religion. A fluid work that defies complete encapsulation and summary
description.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This work is not intended to be a portfolio of my technological
expertise, as much as it is a work of artistic expression and a gradual
accumulation of thoughts to support an independently created system of
philosophy and religion.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Therefore this work should not be used to gauge my skills in
technology, but can be used as a measure of my productivity and ongoing
commitment to long term projects and to critical thinking and reasoning,
and writing.</p>

with Cactuses</a></h2>
<p><em>Preface: Regarding unknowability in the gifted.</em></p>
<p><em>Posted initially on FB, on November 11th.</em></p>
<p>If you are very gifted, and you are speaking often, nearly
constantly, and honestly, I think more is still hidden than for those
who are not, and hardly ever tell the truth, or speak often.</p>
<p>Reason: communication has throughput limits. Plus for those who are
gifted, the throughput limit is on the dumb’s side too. (I.e. “Dumb: you
didn’t say that much and you didn’t understand that much.”).</p>
<p>Consider the handicapped and mentally retarded, or those much more
deficient. Suppose they are open, and honest, and communicative. They
can’t share much. Suppose, a highly gifted person is open, and honest,
and communicative: you still feel you know less than with the
handicapped person, who communicated little.</p>
<p>Arguably, regulars, are much like the handicapped, in their inability
to communicate, even if they were maximally open, honest, and
communicative. They are not any of these things. And they can’t receive
from the gifted.</p>
<p>So even if a gifted person, is open, honest, and extremely
communicative, they are still more unknown to all, and nearly totally
unknown to the ungifted, who can’t even hear.</p>
<p>Imagine if you are gifted, open, honest AND communicative, and you
are still not having any communion.</p>
<p>Eventually it’s like trying to have communion with cactuses. (yes,
cacti).</p>

Camera Eyeballs and Your Citizenship</a></h2>
<p><em>Preface: At Birth You Agreed to Be Technology.</em></p>
<p><em>Posted on Facebook on November, 5<sup>th</sup>, 2022.</em></p>
<p>You agree to social rules and customs and believe yourself belonging
to your regional people, yet if you were born in the future, in a
scenario in which life connected more with computing and hardware, you
might find your eyes are cheap old cameras, and not newer more expensive
ones.</p>
<p>Your senses and your experiences might be forced to be cheap ones,
and ones that can be taken away or worsened without your permission.</p>
<p>Whereas some other group was made to have much better.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>If you live in a small country you have tiny eyeballs.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>What do you really get at birth that makes you decide</p>
<p>“I’m going to adopt all these rules</p>
<p>My shopping for traits and features was so good, I’d let someone else
do it.”</p>
<p>And then you realize nobody cared really or shopped for your features
or parts but you said</p>
<p>“This is the best life.”</p>
<p>“I agree to all legal after the fact.”</p>
<p>Rationalization or purchase and contract, and continued use?</p>

without cell phones again.</a></h2>
<p><em>Preface: Traveling without cellphone needs.</em></p>
<p><em>Started Writing: Wednesday, October 26<sup>th</sup>,
2022</em>, <time>00:14:07 Mattanaw Reference Time A v01 UTC</time></p>
<p>Recently I’ve become more interested in finding normal ways to
function while traveling without using a cell phone, and without feeling
any dependency on a cell phone to accomplish what should be simple
tasks. Things that were simple tasks before, but are not now.</p>
<p>The encroachment on independence from cell phones seems manifested in
growing disinclinations to do certain easy acts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Getting on a public bus in a new bus system unreflectively.<br />
</li>
<li>Trying out a metro or subway system without first reading about it,
or obtaining an app on the phone.</li>
<li>Waiting for things, when it is not clear how long the wait would
be.</li>
<li>There is a desire to be told by an application if it is worth
waiting or not. I noticed this while waiting for a bus recently.</li>
<li>Getting a taxi, or a ride someplace.</li>
<li>There is a hard dependency on taxi-apps at present for this, to
obtain lower rates. However, depending on the apps may increase usage,
and may decrease ability to act without the app. I.e. for a greater cost
using a taxi, one may be more skilled obtaining transit alone. If taxi
is felt to be too expensive, one might be more fit and able to save for
willingness to walk.</li>
<li>Walking.</li>
<li>Having an easy way to get a ride implies that it will be used more
often, even for shorter trips.</li>
<li>Finding directions, and being spatially aware.</li>
<li>Growing up I was very inclined to know where I was and to use maps
if I needed directions. Now I rarely think to use maps and feel
disinclined to think through where I am without using a phone. I’m very
skilled at this but I’m still disinclined. At this moment I wonder what
it might mean for the mental developments of youths, who may always feel
inclined to use the phone and strongly disinclined to learn the basics
of determinging alone one’s spatial orientation and ways to get places
and back.</li>
<li>Communicating using other methods.
<ul>
<li>Recently on arrival in a new location I found I did not have cell
service at the time I was wanting to check into an AirBnB. The host of
that AirBnB did not give me a way to get into my room without first
contacting him on arrival. Fortunately, I found the door open, and
simply went inside. But considering it would be locked, I thought
through what inconveniences I would experience trying to get inside. I
had many possessions and wasn’t near an available Wi-Fi. I would have
had to walk some distance in a new location to find a business that
would provide me Wi-Fi, at some cost since there is a feeling of
indebtness for using such service. This inconvenience was small,
however, particularly in retrospect, because after I came to learn the
area, I found there were plenty of businesses that would likely provide
me the needed wifi. Using the phone would have diminished the ease and
speed of learning the new area. Using the phone made me disinclined to
consider finding wifi an easy task. Before I would have had to find a
pay phone, which was never felt to be too bothersome, even without
funds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>I think this may be a very short list, but these are certainly common
tasks related to traveler’s needs.</p>
<p>What are some methods I can use now? What are some short term and
long term goals I can use, to gradually diminish my dependency.</p>
<p>Firstly, I have decided that I will use my computer in an offline
setting more often, making myself more comfortable and confident being
disconnected. It’s strange that one can do much that is fun and
productive without ever connecting to the internet or launching a web
browser. Typically I would do this writing connected to the internet,
doing other activities that are network dependent intermittently between
writings, but at present I’m disconnected and do not feel a strong
inclination to have even Wifi.</p>
<p>Secondly, I think I will rely on asking people questions more often.
Even simple questions such as “How do I pay for a bus here, and how much
does it cost?” seem more difficult. However, it is very easy to walk up
to a bus driver arriving on schedule to a station to ask the same
questions, as this is a service that they provide regularly anyhow. In
this way I can get on a bus without any planning or without any
application. Writing this feels somewhat silly, but really I have been
disinclined to try it, and I’m certain others would be too arriving in a
new location for the first time.</p>
<p>Thirdly, I will try the rail system at my new location without any
use of technology. I’ll rely on the maps they provide at the station,
their cues in the machines for how to pay and how much, and I will use
my many decades of experience traveling as actual usable knowledge
again, to go through various gates, to catch trains, and to make
connections. “Shouldn’t I know how to do this without any thinking at
all at any place nearly, by now, knowing more generally, these systems
function in the same way mostly every time?”</p>
<p>While enjoying my travels I focus on taking photographs over making
purchases to have memorabilia, and to record my more pleasant
experiences. To do this, I have shifted in my life span from manual film
cameras, to disposable film cameras, to polaroids, to a dedicated
digital camera, to cell-phone cameras. After taking tens of thousands of
photos with my cell phone camera, enjoying its being combined wtih other
uses so I have mostly a standalone device, I am now seeing tendencies in
phone software that I do not enjoy, such as inability to transfer files
easily, and to control their formats, and some indicators that cell
phone companies and mobile apps will use the photos even without
permission. For this and other reasons closer to my experience in
software and content management and productions, I’m shifting to using
my dedicated professional camera instead.</p>
<p>Recently I was considering that a primary reason for carrying my cell
phone is really the camera. If I’m not on the network doing something
social, I’m planning to do something social later, and frequently this
includes some planning around photos I’m taking.</p>
<p>An implication is I have to carry the camera in addition to the
phone, or alone without a phone, but since I’m carrying a very high
quality camera it will result in an improvement on my productions
abilities so this is fine.</p>
<p>Another motive for having my phone is for having music. I don’t think
I will stop using this function quite yet as I find it too enjoyable;
however, I can do so without being attached to the network with some
planning. I have used my website in the past for accumulating playlists
and have recorded off those playlists, files which I can carry around
and listen to at any time. In this way I can listen to music without
that dependency on the network, which is really annoying given networks
are pushing people to remain dependent on staying on network, without
ownership of content anyhow. I’d prefer to have instant access to my own
files without any need to use and pay for data, and have someone else
management my music. Managing music is not something I’m wanting to do,
but again, this disinclination to manage and own my own music is related
to phone usage and dependency on cell and wifi networks.</p>
<p>Regarding maps and directions, I intend to ask questions, find maps
already recorded at bus stations and other locations, and to use my
natural abilities which require some attention to my surroundings.
Attention to surroundings seems like something of value, and I even
admit that attending to my phone for directions on google maps means I’m
avoiding doing such things as recognizing trees and landmarks that could
easily be used to find my way back home. In my recent walks I’ve found
that I can get around just as easily as I always could, and so there
should not be much trouble stopping my use of google maps.</p>
<p>There are some losses however, like for getting directions quickly if
driving someplace new. But I’m finding that downloading large maps on
google, even huge land areas, is easy now since storage space on devices
is not an issue. You can download maps for entire cities and chunks of
countries and rely on those for directions if totally necessary. Some
really basic advance planning is needed (but consider you could go on
your phone now, and download an entire region or set of regions and not
need any other planning). Doing this I can use my phone for maps without
a network connection, and I can use it more like normal print maps
without desiring real-time updates for traffic and recalculations on
turn-by-turn directions which became annoying. I’d much prefer looking
at the map, seeing which roads go to a destination, and simply use my
instincts without the maps to get there, using memory.</p>
<p>Finally, thinking about my experience with this AirBnB host, I could
have done the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>At the time of booking, inform my host that I may not have a method
of communication on arrival. I could re-use this message routinely so
the host is thining in advance of how I will get in without aid.</li>
<li>At the time of booking, I can simply look at the area to see if I
can anticipate wifi being readily available at different
businesses.</li>
<li>I can exchange contact details in advance, so I’m not trying to find
contact details without a connection. That was an issue during my
arrival since the app did not have working messaging, and wouldn’t load
new windows to get to certain details. Even though I don’t have a cell
phone, someone does. I could easily let them know of my predicament and
they may be willing to briefly allow cell phone use. Simply asking
someone is fine, and they may be willing to take payment, if socially
this has become more of a strange inquiry.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are other devices that allow communication without any cell
service. For example, my garmin allows satellite comm, via text message.
I could easily use that instead of my phone for texting as long as I
have working numbers. This also would permit getting off the cell phone
network, with some safety features which are desirable too, although it
requires having another small device with me.</p>

control how you reflect and think, and remember.</a></h2>
<p><em>Preface: You’ll think of other things until next year.</em></p>
<p><em>Sunday, October 8<sup>th</sup>, 2022</em>, <time>12:20 AM Utah
Time</time></p>
<p>Holidays are a method of control in which you are allowed to reflect
a certain way, and consider certain topics, only rarely.</p>
<p>Annually.</p>
<p>And in the annual reflections, are rules about what is included and
what conclusions are had, or remembered.</p>
<p>It is a method of enforced recollection and not a method of
revisitation and genuine rememberance for re-processing and
learning.</p>
<p>A confirmation that this is the case is that it is not open to
reconsider whether the holiday should</p>
<p>continue.</p>
<p>Not only is it not for consideration whether it will continue, it is
not for consideration, really, how celebrations will be performed</p>
<p>ritually.</p>
<p>If one is attentive this really does reduce freedom around what can
be thought, recollected, remembered, reprocessed, and changed.</p>
<p>Suppose you try to think through and change, or celebrate, or revisit
frequently, any of these holidays:</p>
<ul>
<li>Christmas</li>
<li>Independence day (or some nationalistic day)</li>
<li>Memorial day</li>
<li>Labor Day</li>
<li>Halloween</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>“I will celebrate and change Christmas 8 times a year.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“I will remember veterans every weekend, and each weekend, criticise
what remembering them means and implies for what we will do.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“I will revisit independence day and celebrate it differently,
sometimes favorably, sometimes less so, once a month.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>…</p>
<p>These ways of celebrating, criticizing, altering, are disallowed by
others, who also celebrate</p>
<p>Freedom of religion and speech,</p>
<p>and call for:</p>
<p>“remembering always and forever” this and that.</p>
<p>Holidays appear to me to be methods of ensuring that one’s mind does
not depart on certain topics too far from ways that others think about
it.</p>
<p>They control how you think of them.</p>
<p>That they are annual is strange on reflection. They are not based on
seasons if one considers that they are celebrated globally.</p>
<p>If their subject matter is important enough, one can celebrate
ritually more frequently than annually, and can do so with the ability
to think about it carefully and make any changes desired.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“You will observe the holidays, observe them similarly, and do so
only once a year.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Outside of that period</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“You will think about other things.”</p>
</blockquote>

Remembrance slightly off schedule.</a></h2>
<p><em>Preface: Pretending your value in 911 and in COVID. Pretending
your value when the news calls for it. Remembering it whenever you
want.</em></p>
<p><em>Saturday, October 8<sup>th</sup>, 2022</em>, <time>11:29 PM Utah
Time</time></p>
<p>I was alive and an adult during 911 so my recollections seem to have
some special value, akin to the recollections of events of major wars.
So I will here remember according to my own recollections, being a sort
of primary source on 911 history.</p>
<p>I think many who were in New York at the time of the event found a
variety of ways to be “cool” and “relevant” at the time of the
occurrence.</p>
<p>More especially, I think NYPD and the New York Firemen used it as a
chance to claim a special project involvement to advance careers and to
pretend self importance.</p>
<p>During 911 there was no “shitty cop” and no “useless firefighter”,
but the reality is there were.</p>
<p>Across the country, people were suddenly, like with COVID, believing
themselves to have importance, and value, if they latched onto this
situation, to pretend to be part of some kind of reactionary solution.
If they could make themselves part of the story, then somehow, they have
increased their value.</p>
<p>But I don’t think in retrospect, these same people remember having
advanced their value by having certain opinions and reactions in
relation to the events.</p>
<p>Being closer to New York City, one must have felt a greater
connection. Being near DC I was inundated with quite a lot of news
related to the Pentagon and NYC, yet, I did not feel my personal value
increasing.</p>
<p>NYC firefighters and cops are not special in any measurable way I can
think of apart from urban specializations that would not exist across
the united states, that might exist in NYC. Cultural differences also
might be of interest, between cops in NYC and cops elsewhere. However,
an anomalous event in which they were not trained, in which some were
deployed (but not all), seems to indicate unpreparedness and inability
more than expertise. How could they be expert for a first occurrence in
which the buildings were demolished with people inside? But to latch
onto such an event, there can be a pretense that expertise was acquired,
and that heroism in lack of expert work was achieved.</p>
<p>There were people latching onto the event in order to further their
careers and pretend involvement, to establish “I was there”, when “I was
there” was “I didn’t do anything special at all but watch”.</p>
<p>It’s like 911 was a first time simulation, a training event for
something not ever repeated, in which being near qualified one for
heroism and expertise.</p>
<p>COVID and 911 seem very similar to me in that people were
ineffective, but pretend somehow they were valuable because it
happened.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Watch the news and wait for the next thing to happen that will allow
you to pretend your value.”</p>

<blockquote>
<ol type="1">
<li>comprehensive propensities I am enthusiastic over humanity’s
extraordinary and sometimes very timely ingenuities. If you are in a
shipwreck and all the boats are gone, a piano top buoyant enough to keep
you afloat that comes along makes a fortuitous life preserver. But this
is not to say that the best way to design a life preserver is in the
form of a piano top. I think that we are clinging to a great many piano
tops in accepting yesterday’s fortuitous contrivings as constituting the
only means for solving a given problem. Our brains deal exclusively with
special-case experiences. Only our minds are able to discover the
generalized principles operating without exception in each and every
special-experience case which if detected and mastered will give
knowledgeable advantage in all instances. Because our spontaneous
initiative has been frustrated, too often inadvertently, in earliest
childhood we do not tend, customarily, to dare to think competently
regarding our potentials. We find it socially easier to go on with our
narrow, shortsighted specialization’s and leave it to others—primarily
to the politicians—to find some way of resolving our common dilemmas.
Countering that spontaneous grownup trend to narrowness I will do my,
hopefully “childish,” best to confront as many of our problems as
possible by employing the longest-distance thinking of which I am
capable—though that may not take us very far into the future. Having
been trained at the U. S. Naval Academy and practically experienced in
the powerfully effective forecasting arts of celestial navigation,
pilotage, ballistics, and logistics, and in the long-range,
anticipatory, design science governing yesterday’s naval mastery of the
world from which our present day’s general systems theory has been
derived, I recall that in 1927 I set about deliberately exploring to see
how far ahead we could make competent forecasts regarding the direction
in which all humanity is trending and to see how effectively we could
interpret the physical details of what comprehensive evolution might be
portending as disclosed by the available data. I came to the conclusion
that it is possible to make a fairly reasonable forecast of about
twenty-five years. That seems to be about one industrial “tooling”
generation. On the average, all inventions seem to get melted up about
every twenty-five years, after which the metals come back into
recirculation in new and usually more effective uses. At any rate, in
1927 I evolved a forecast. Most of my 1927’S prognosticating went only
to 1952—that is, for a quarter-century, but some of it went on for a
half-century, to 1977.”</li>

<p>Response:</p>
<p>A fellow Mensan friend posted the following excerpt from
Mr. Buckminster Fuller, pointing out the end comments on the topic of
generations. Following a reading of the excerpt, I gave the response
shown below.</p>
<p>[Mensan friend}, I still have not given Fuller’s work the attention I
thought it would, but this excerpt is enough for me to want to revisit
what you shared earlier. Much in here is interesting, and relates to
many subjects that I’m thinking about… aside from just the OP, which is
probably I’m guessing why you’ve retained it, or have it easily linked
mentally.</p>
<p>I was thinking a bit on my recent reading of Adam Smith’s work on
economics. In his writing, he talks over reactions to changes of prices
of grains, in centuries before his own period, and before the
publication of his work in 1776. In it there are some indications that
there were fewer changes (which we know from the period’s being before
the industrial revolution, and various accelerations), and I think there
would be less perception about differences between parent and child,
regarding the way they would live and work, and consume. Going on some
reading on the history of Egypt, from Robert’s History of the World,
there was even less perception of change, and that there could be change
(which would explain why in early history there could be debates upon
whether change existed, or why some would think animal species could be
immutable). Thinking of that, I wondered about Fuller’s idea that 25
years could be workable. I think it can’t be, because he would not be
able to have that view on induction, but rather, it would be a feel
about what is happening now. Perhaps it is a perception of current paces
of certain technologies in relation to lifespans (i.e. I’m 75, and this
40 year old assumes that this technology always existed, yet I clearly
remember when…). But 200 years ago, the age separation may have been 75
to 10, for large changes. The implication is that for certain
technologies, there are no changes between living age groups even
between the oldest and the very youngest, and without such a change, no
generational difference would exist.</p>
<p>Going by that last sentence, I think I have an explanation for the
relevance of acceleration of technological changes, and think that
Fuller’s view would be more current, but that going backwards, we would
find markers of generational change to be perhaps smaller in number and
more widely separated. It is somewhat interesting to think that now,
maybe the better number is 10 years and not 25, or something less (But
that focuses on changes that are happening and not what’s remaining
similar).</p>
<p>And then there are parallel technological growths happening at
different rates. Which to focus on, to explain one people as being
different from the other, or so they can self-separate?</p>
<p>That’s if going by technological change. I don’t know how often large
changes of other types were likely to happen. I.e. wars, pestilences,
and other uncertainties, which might exist for parents but not for
children. But these would be perceived as perhaps being cyclical
unchanging things to deal with, widely separate, and not about
change.</p>
<p>There is more that I wanted to include but probably thinking further
on it is better than writing more for the moment.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Thinking a bit more on this topic, I wonder why there might be any
clinging to the idea of “generation”. I do find myself wanting to use
it, and not totally remove it.</p>
<p>It seems to be this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Everyone in one group of people, living at the same time,
experienced a same happening, and were living near enough to each other
to have been affected.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This would make generations a regional thing and an experiential
thing, which we already unerstand because the context of generational
differences are always regional, or somewhat national in focus. Even
when international, it does not include everyone, what was shared in a
large experience. Unless it was astronomical or catastrophic and
affected everyone and perhaps every animal on the planet.</p>
<p>It is odd to think it is possible that all animal life could be of
the same generation, marking a difference from subsequent
generations.</p>
<p>But going back to the main point I was wanting to make. If your
parents and everyone who was living after you and all your siblings had
the same experience, your group of people born after the date that that
experience was no longer experience-able, is in one way of another
generation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“You weren’t alive when this happened, but all of us were.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seems to be a good cause for thinking one set of people could be
markedly different in various ways than another on what could not have
been experienced by later generations.</p>
<p>However, using this idea to mark generations would only work if we
are selective about which changes we were concerned to include, and
their size. We would want big changes, and not small ones, so that those
who are newly born, would have very little understanding of what
preceded.</p>
<p>An issue, however, is there is no assurance that huge changes won’t
be rapid, and that generations may not be 4 years apart then, versus 20
years apart. Siblings can experience the world in ways with large
differences, and while their ages may not be as far separate as parents
and their babies, they can be quite large such that they feel very
different in their histories.</p>
<p>These considerations give some explanation concerning what seems
wrong also in the idea of generations, that:</p>
<p>“We seem to be selective in what marks one generation from the next,
and there are many alternatives; but we don’t want to use them all.”</p>
<p>We don’t want to use them all though, because we want to keep things
simple, and have only one timetable. But probably it is better to do
away with generations and speak about what the differences are, using a

vs. Professional, Work vs. Leisure</a></h2>
<p><em>Preface: In a response to a comment regarding the value of
work.</em></p>
<p><em>Monday, October 3<sup>rd</sup>, 2022</em>, <time>9:37 PM Utah
Time</time></p>
<p>I’m for work certainly, but am suspicious about the meanings people
have for “not work”, “retirement”, etc… I have become part retired, but
am extremely active doing things which are identified with work. I have
related irritations concerning the professional/amateur distinction. It
also varies cyclically and over the lifespan, and to have a view that
work, in a professional capacity, is too important, one may have
difficulties over and above others in the change that retirement
brings.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Outside of this comment I’ve said much about it already elsewhere.
Leisure time is required for doing things that people would like to do,
if that work done is not the same as professional work, that produces
money. Someone who wants to write, develop an artistic skill, or do
anything else of cultural value and importance that is not paid for, or
something that is simply meaningful for the self, then one will need
what has been termed leisure time to do it. This implies that one is
doing less that would earn money at the time they are developing the
skill, than they would be, if they are working on gaining funds; also
this is what is hoped to be done during retirement if there is
sufficient energy and motivation to do so.</p>
<p>It is really weird how there has been a division between amateur and
professional. Amateurs seem to be called what they are because they have
not gained enough savings or resources (or perhaps motivation), to
continue on with developing a skill to the point of mastery, in the same
way that a person who is working in an occupation does, in relation to
their occupation, if they are passionate and are also incentivized by
unrelated benefits like money, market (popularity), and attention
(relates to market). Professionals, we know, have an easier time doing
what they do because their efforts blend things which seem intrinsically
valuable (doing what one likes, and creating what one desires, or
solving problems, gaining knowledge, etc…), and needs of livelihood,
which include social comforts, and freedom from worry in satisfaction of
needs.</p>
<p>This is another area where it really appears measurement is useful,
as it may relate to activities. There is so much dichotomous talking on
points such as these, that result in people flip-flopping between one
side and the other of the polarity. I said something of polarization
illusions and this would be an example, in that one might believe these
are opposed, when the actuality is this is about types of activities and
behaviors and the results they bring, and the proportions of one type of
activity and another in time/energy available. It does not appear to me
that considerations on this are not somewhat small in total, and
certainly finite, and I think with some modest effort one can complete
this topic and the result would be one of sophistication and not one
that is about debates over whether one should work or not. It also
doesn’t appear, that after this approach is taken, anyone would want to
fall into one camp or another. Rather, people would simply discuss how
they out to variously use their time, given different measures, and the
diversity of their traits as different animals.</p>

id="ridding-of-the-generation-concept-for-current-and-future-population-groupings."><a name="ridding-of-the-generation-concept-for-current-and-future-population-groupings">Ridding
of the “Generation” concept, for current and future population
groupings.</a></h2>
<p><em>Tuesday, September 27<sup>th</sup>, 2022</em>, <time>1:29 PM
Arizona Time</time></p>
<p>I’m particular unfond of the use of popularized groupings we call
“generations”, which collect people in rough ranges, such that those
born within those groups think they have important life-long
commonalities.</p>
<p>There are many obvious issues with this method of grouping, too
numerous to record, but a few serious issues are that:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is no naming convention that resembles anything
systematic.</li>
<li>There are no standards concerning the boundaries (i.e. the start and
end date of a generation).</li>
<li>The groupings are too large, and do not take regions into
consideration so much as time.</li>
<li>They are used to explain too much about behavior of those within the
group, and meaningfulness to history.</li>
<li>Seems to guide history since popular: people come to agree that
really such groups exist, and begin to self-designate with the labels,
and claim belongingness.</li>
</ul>
<p>The asystematic nature of the categories, “Gen-Z”, “Millenial”,
“Gen-Y”, “Gen-X”, “Baby-Boomer”, “Greatest Generation”-“er”, and so on,
indicates the method of creation of the generations might be media
based, or news based.</p>
<p>However, it also appears such a tendency exists for historical
groupings looking backwards in history, in that groupings are done very
roughly, for not having great precision. Tribes, nations, and many types
of groups receive boundaries which seem to supply the historian what is
needed to convey stories. They find landmarks that are not geographical,
and use them to make separations, and create groups. When creating
timelines, they pick out events which appear to create group related
changes on a social level, and that is what is being done in the
creation of “Millenials” and so on. Technology changes, war related
changes, shifts over to a new millenium, and so on are used, to group
people who otherwise might not be grouped together.</p>
<p>If the media and news is the source of terms like “Greatest
Generation” and “Gen-X”, and they use the terminology long enough,
making it popularly employed, then the Historian will need to use the
same language or mention it, whenever it is relevant to their history.
This implies that the media and historians would work together in
perpetuating the concept of a generation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“But is such a concept of a generation scientific and precise?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It certainly is not. It assumes that a non-scientific approach to
grouping people in generations is one that takes precedence even above a
scientific approach for grouping people according to procreation
occurring at population levels for differing land areas, in a number of
ways. It assumes that, people shouldn’t be thinking about how they can
be grouped in a number of ways to describe what they are really like,
and the various ways they align with the historical timeline of events,
which really do influence their behavior, and have been created by them,
depending on which event is under consideration.</p>
<p>A person wanting to be scientific will not, as someone from a social
group I belong to comment remind me, use “Astrology” to chunk human
groups and behaviors.</p>
<p>A person wanting to be scientific will not, pretend that a group of
27 years, as with the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_Generation">Greatest
Generation</a>, which is supposedly the group of those born 1901-1927
inclusive, is useful beyond something really specific wanting to be
communicated. Which is another serious issue with the generational
concept: apart from a specific historical narrative on one topic of
interest, like data around people born before, and living through and
beyond, WWII. Popular culture and the media will continue to refer to
this group again and again outside of this context as a convenient way
of more permanently grouping them together, for other purposes. And
again, the historian later, will have to utilize the same generational
concept because the media has used it in various ways that contribute to
other events and behaviors.</p>
<p>It is possible to utilize another method taking from the media it’s
asystematic and undetailed method of creating generations, to using a
more scientific method that has many grouping methods, which then would
be used to communicate with the public in a more sophisticated fashion,
and which would be used by historians in a way which would inherit the
quality of the science at the time.</p>
<p>Here I’m not discussing how this might be achieved, and for various
ways it might be infeasible, because the media does not appear to want
to research about science, or receive advice from science, on how to
communicate with their audience. Also, the audience expects plain
language, and plain language is related to what they are accustomed to.
So it appears that both the audience and the media would not be wanting
to suddenly rely on scientific methods of grouping and Demographics,
which is supposedly a real science, definitely abandoned largely in our
use of these popular generational concepts, in order to get things
right. They are unable to tell anything is wrong with such an approach.
However, historians will make use of these same concepts, and then it
appears the historians are being less scientific, by being guided to an
extent, in using these popular concepts, which need to be used, to
explain the people who used them and the media that advertised the
use.</p>
<p>There is a strange issue here, in that the historian, then, should
still step back, and look at the history in a more detailed way, using
dates and a more scientific method of grouping people according to
actual similarities that might exist, and not too broad and irrelevant a
grouping method. This means to get things right, the historian would
need to do both: use the terms as they were used in the media (and
therefore in primary sources) AND use the scientific methods of grouping
to get the history right. But by appearances it seems they start using
the popularly used groupings without taking that step back. They use the
conventional or traditional groupings which became conventional and
traditional via popular use.</p>
<p>Probably there are historians who attempt a greater level of detail
than this, and I can recall some writings in which better regional and
date related pieces of information are used– but it does also appear
that they do similarly themselves grouping things further back in time,
and will use the same terms from the primary sources themselves. Perhaps
better historians do more to take a step back, and group alternatively
according to what historical science would guide, and not simply utilize
terms like “baby boomer”, as a primary method for telling the historical
story to their audience.</p>
<p>It would be interesting to survey current historical work and see to
what extent the popular divisions of generations were used to relay the
story, without altering the groupings to more sophisticated groupings,
that historical science would require.</p>
<p>Having not really studied the discipline of demographics itself, it
appears that would offer solutions for better grouping and measuring
populations of people, than what is currently done with these
generational concepts.</p>
<p>When I think of a “generation” at a basic level concerning a group, I
think of all the babies that were produced at the same time, for that
group. In other words, I would not belong to the same generation as my
brother or my sister, but I may roughly belong to the same generation of
all my classmates at my school, born in that same region, and living
there without relocation (which also complicates things). There are
large differences between the life I experienced and the life of my
brother, although certainly, because the difference is only about 3
years, they can be overlooked for various purposes. But if those
differences cannot be overlooked, then the generation we belong to is
not the same, on the demarcations required for that use of
generation.</p>
<p>Notice that for our use of “Millenial” however, we have by some
sources a separation of 20 years, including all babies born between 1980
and 2000. I was born in 1980, and my brother in 1983. The degree of
separation between myself and people born in the 90s is very great in
terms of early life experiences, and the difference is massive. I have
been called a “Millenial” at work, while I’m 20 years older than those
who were being negatively imagined (this was an older colleague).</p>
<p>Oddly, some sources state that I’m not a “Millenial”, but in “Gen X”,
having the dates for “Gen X” going from 1965-1980”, and a “Millenial”
from “1981” to “1997”. This would place my brother in another
classification, far too different from my own. Some would place me with
one group, and another, because I straddle both, which implies that
anyone living near a demarcation will be greatly misunderstood. At one
moment I’m compared with those living in 1965 who are remember, with
nostalgia oftentimes, earlier ways of living. Then suddenly, I’m shifted
to much more youthful people, who are living lives still somewhat under
interpretation.</p>
<p>While this colleague at work refered to me as a Millenial, I was
thinking things connecting me not only with Gen X, but earlier
generations. Because my exposure to older behaviors and culture was not
the same as it was for others, and included more and not less of what
preceded. I’m comparing myself in many ways to people born in the 60s as
if I too were born in that period, and certainly not someone 20 years
old in 2016.</p>
<p>My preference is greatly to rely on specific dates and happenings to
group and regroup as needed for thinking through topics of interest. As
I think about it now, I don’t think I would ever need to use a
generational grouping akin to “Gen-X”, unless I were specifically
analyzing something that included that group specifically, with that
level of non-detail, and then I would never use it again. But we use it
over and over and that is certainly illustrative of the problem. We
would need and want to regroup for any analysis we are doing to
constrain the group to what is relevant. This seems to imply that these
generational groupings are hardly ever relevant, and never well applied
if more detail is desired.</p>

you own the software and the words</a></h2>
<p><em>Thursday, September 22<sup>nd</sup>, 2022</em>, <time>3:57 PM
Alaska Time</time></p>
<p>I haven’t said much about this, but being in a happy moment,
migrating my software from my earlier machine to my later machine,
discovering it works without any special effort, I’m unusually
self-satisfied at my accomplishment, of building a software system to
deploy websites, that also functions to deploy my writing, according to
the plan I’ve had for two decades. It does much more than that but that
is a primary piece of functionality. I own the software of my system and
the writing. All the bits are mine, words and code.</p>
<p>It’s been since about 2016 having done this, but today it is better
than ever, and I’m happy to celebrate a little about it.</p>
<p>I’m not sure how many people have built their own system to such an
extent, in a sellable software product, specifically for use for
deployment of their own writings, for total control and ownership.</p>
<p>Of course, I did well in the field of enterprise applications and
have taken what I’ve learned to build my own system. I’m no longer a
software architect so much as a management consultant and business
owner, but I still continue my own development whenever I’m interested
enough. But for a longer period of time, I’ve been a moral philosopher,
and more than wanting to work in computing and related fields, I’ve been
wanting to publish a book on moral philosophy and ethics. This is my
primary field of expertise, and not computing; although doing well in
computing may lead others to think that is my primary area of expertise.
It is not.</p>

response in a conversation on reverse-engineering meaning, unicode
sensors, and sensors.</a></h2>
<p><em>Preface: From an interesting conversation on reverse-engineering
meaning.</em></p>
<p><em>Thursday, September 22<sup>nd</sup>, 2022</em>, <time>3:57 PM
Alaska Time</time></p>
<p>Monica, I was strolling outside thinking about this earlier.
Interesting sense, collecting from a stream of unicode characters only.
Here’s how my thinking relates to that. If I’m a child, and I am exposed
to the earth on other sensations, gradually I become competent at some
specific observations about the world, even without any language. Like a
non-human animal, say, I am able to correctly observe falling objects,
and make predictions, but without using any language. Now suppose I
learn a language of my nation. Knowing that language I can then,
describe what I’m seeing regarding falling objects and predictions I can
make about them, in a way that is congruous with the earlier ability
acquired non-linguistically. Being a human, at current state of
language, there would be, sometimes, a recognition of inadequacy in the
language, to describe what is experienced, but nevertheless, I could
form statements which correspond to parts of the experience, that I
would be more committal to, and regard as true. Now, in that time
learning language, I also acquired reading ability, which is separable
to an extent from the verbal. Now I can type Unicode chars into facebook
which match the verbal statements that would be true regarding my
experiences of falling objects.</p>
<p>As I type, I recognize my type as a stream, originating in actions in
my nervous system through my fingers and the keyboard, flowing into
memory and rendered onto the screen, in sequence from beginning to
end.</p>
<p>Enters Monica’s sensor.</p>
<p>Monica’s sensor is part of a black-box system on another part of the
earth, taking public messaging input from FB. At one particular point in
time, it takes input from my output, and it consists of those sentences
which are those sentences I would consider true, regarding my experience
of falling objects and predictions about those objects (which are
specific to direct experiences). The sensor component alone, in the
system, would have to be doing something which might not correspond to
sensation or it might, but I would have to leave that for you to
articulate further. Is it a biological sensor or digital camera sensor,
or is it a program socket taking input programmatically, and somehow
that is a sensor? All of these are interesting, but it has to be stated
in what sense it is a sensor. Taking an analogy from biology, I would
assume it is sensate, and not a websocket though, and there is some
active scanning or watching happening, maybe some attention and the
like. Which brings to</p>
<p>What is sensate of the sensor and what is processor? The sensor might
be collecting Unicode chars as visual chars on a screen, or, it could be
like a peripheral device, like a keyboard, noticing a stream and
recognizing, which char each char is. A part of that sensor could be a
processor which knows a bit more, or that could be offloaded to a
computing portion of the black box system or a brain.</p>
<p>Here I would say that interpretation may not have happened yet, and
streams of chars may not have become words. It may simply be a sequence
of Unicode Chars and output of what those chars are in a translation
(actual chars to unicode). Knowing that the chars relate to words which
involve true statements, on experiences understood non-linguistically on
years of exposure, these chars sensed, together in larger chunks, would
have potential communication properties, which may result in true
statements being understood, stored, and related, to another set of
experiences in a mind that are not linguistic but are by analogy similar
to those of my own.</p>
<p>However, if the black box system has no additional processing and
only the sensor, it doesn’t seem like it can do anything with the
unicode chars, although it maybe can relay and translate them to
unicode. If that black box includes a brain that has experience similar
to mine, then it can dot he remaining work of interpretation in English,
and has the physical experiences that are analagous to my own, then it
could utilize it, as long as it has the additional interstitial brain to
interpret the unicode, and understand true statements. If it were an AI,
it may have different requirements in order to utilize the unicode, but
to recognize them as true statements, it seems it would require matching
with experience somehow, analagous to what a brain might have or what I
might have.</p>
<p>OK so after all that, I will confirm that a unicode specific sensor
is certainly possible and can relay unicode chars and maybe translate or
reduce to lower code, or some biological equivalent. However, gathering
the meaning I think requires more material than that sensor, because
what is passed along, although it consists of true statements in
language, requires matching to what was acquired using other sensors and
channels in original experience apart from language. I think this would
be true if the sensor was an input to another brain that has those
experiences or another AI that has an analogue to those experiences, but
either way, it appears those experiences have to be present to know that
true statements were shared, and that the statements meant anything
connected with anything physical.</p>
<p>I’m not sure a sensor of vision can be replaced entirely with a
unicode sensor. I think whatever sensor is used has to be one that is
interacting with nature physically in a way like vision, like sonar, but
I’m not sure a unicode sensor could do that. So it seems a heterogeneous
system is needed of a number of sensor types.</p>
<p>(This is all more to your first comment and not your second. I
somewhat agree as to your statements although would think about it a
little differently. I don’t accept that there is a language device so
agree on that too.)</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Monica another thought. I think what might be useful is to have a
catalog of necessary sensors, and know which if any can be replaced with
a unicode sensor (and decide what sensing that unicode sensor has if
only programmatic and not visual, or something else). When I think of
instrumentation on unicode sensors I keep thinking of physical
properties if not done with software, and if done with software it seems
less sensate or insensate entirely.</p>

<h2
id="challenging-claims-of-ignorance"><a name="challenging-claims-of-ignorance">Challenging
Claims of Ignorance</a></h2>
<p><em>Preface: [This seems to be of philosophical interest because it
involves actually handling skepticism in a pragmatic way. It seems to
erode skepticism, even if a little. You are not permitted to simply
claim someone is ignorant. This would be helpful against bad
philosophy]</em></p>
<p><em>Wednesday, September 21<sup>st</sup>, 2022</em>, <time>1:59 PM
Arizona Time</time></p>
<p>If someone happens to claim that you have an ignorant perspective,
this means they happen to have a view as to what is missing in your
education. This also means, they have the expertise to direct you to
resources that would fill those knowledge gaps, and teach you, what it
is that is missing. It could be extensive, but even if extensive, the
recognition of a lack, indicates one can speak about the lack.
Otherwise, it is not actually clear to the person making the claim, that
there is a lack; which would mean, they are not really motivated on an
insight as to missing education or knowledge, but something else. Even
if there are extensive gaps, it is really easy for a teacher to show
where to look for information, or to provide a list of subjects and
topics to study. They should even be able to share some information,
having the knowledge already, that would exist in those materials. If
that cannot be done, then either they have learned it on their own
experience, or, they may not have really learned anything that they
claim expertise regarding. Such an expert, then, may go so far as to
fraudulently point you to topics, subjects, and materials they have not
read but only have some awareness concerning.</p>
<p>From the above it can be seen that challenges to any claims that you
or someone else is ignorant would require knowledge that would resolve
the ignorance, and therefore you can combat it by simply seeking out,
from that person who made the claim, that knowledge they think is
needed.</p>
<p>An additional issue is that while they may have the knowledge, it
doesn’t mean you don’t. This occurs very frequently, when someone
presumes that someone else would have conclusions on the same
information that would be the same as the person listening or reading.
People will respond to what I write thinking that they have more
knowledge because they have a different conclusion; however, I often
quickly show, that I have more knowledge than they do, which is the
cause of having a better opinion. So it can even be, that someone who is
more ignorant, will claim you are ignorant, on the basis of not having
the conclusions they have had, on the limited information they had,
which they thought was higher knowledge. It turns out they had less!</p>
<p>The debate as to who has more knowledge still depends on a
conversation about what knowledge is required and missing, and someone
who makes a claim that you or someone else is ignorant still needs to
say what information is needed or which subjects or topics are required,
for fully understanding what conclusions should be had.</p>

it all before you die” falsified.</a></h2>
<p><em>Wednesday, September 21<sup>st</sup>, 2022</em>, <time>12:59 PM
Arizona Time</time></p>
<p>[<em>Note: this is unedited and not spell checked, for important
purposes mentioned here: http://www.mattanaw.com/editing.html</em>]</p>
<p>Some refer to lists of things one would really like to do, bucket
lists.</p>
<p>I would suggest that these are things people would really like to do,
that they are willing to procrastinate regarding.</p>
<p>If not procrastinate, they use the list to defer action until later,
which can be reasonable, but it appears that is not the case, since the
risk is dying before completing the list. “Bucket lists” are “Do it
before you die lists”, not “risk not doing these things before death
lists”.</p>
<p>I think it is worthwhile for people, truly, to do many activities,
and learn much, and have experiences they are wanting to have,
throughout their lives. Procrastinating about doing items on a list,
attached to a death milestone, really does seem to motivate doing the
items later, or not at all.</p>
<p>A nice thing about these lists, is they could include items that are
riskier, because if death is immanent, and one will do the items later
in life, closer to death, or closer to when one really might expect
death, one can do things one wouldn’t otherwise do. That would be
another kind of list than what people really envision concerning the
bucket list.</p>
<p>I have such a list and it includes finally indulging in drug
cocktails, and flying in hot air or hydrogen balloons without plans. And
similar other fun and deleterious activiites.</p>
<p>The purpose of this post wasn’t really to show that these lists are
risky, though. The primary message I want to get across about these
lists is that they ought not be connected with death, but merely should
be a backlog of items to complete when reasonable enough to really do,
in a timely fashion, to have a more fulfilling life.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“But Matt, what is the problem connecting that with death? ‘Do it
before you die’, seems fine to me.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The issue is that after you die, you will not look back upon what
you’ve completed and receive rewards for having completed those things.
Furthermore, if you die, having checked boxes right before death is not
something you will experience again, as an accomplishment of all you
wanted to do. You’re dead, did you know that? That means you are not
there…</p>
<p>But there’s more than that. If you get old, and you do things late,
you’ll wonder why you didn’t just have a more experience rich and
fulfilling life the whole time. This connects with another compalint of
the elderly, that one should do things earlier while it can be enjoyed.
Bucket lists or death lists, really do encourage simply finishing, with
a false promise of enjoyment after life has ended. But what the elderly
want is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I have lived a rich and fulfilling life, and in my remaining years,
I can enjoy remembering those times, and a feeling of contentment and
completeness.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The confusion here is that the enjoyment would be after death, and
not after a time in which active life was possible. That still not good
enough, actually, as I think about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You really would be most happy if you were contented at the start of
your life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This indicates that whatever you need to start doing to have a good
fulfilling life, you need to do even earlier than you think.</p>
<p>This indicates that we have very low standards about quality of life,
and that the elderly have not figured this out yet.We should be trying
to make children content enough, so that they could die feeling
fulfilled already.</p>
<p>If children become aware they will die, we work really hard to make
them feel like all has been good enough, from the beginning of their
life, to the present.</p>
<p>But we don’t know when anyone is going to die! Certainly all of the
objectives of life are while living, and this includes having to plan
for not knowing when life will end, and to include all things one
wants</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While living.</p>

<p>There is an interesting phenomena I think with growing intelligence
in a species, or else in sophistication of culture, enabling rational
thought through education. Rational planning of children becomes opposed
to allowing sexual desire to have its usual effects, of producing
children without need for planning. If it doesn’t lead some to have
none, like myself (and I was married 19 years), it would lead people to
have less. Unless a use for children resulted in incentives to have more
(government stimulation for war preparation, or for slavery).</p>

id="the-assumption-that-human-life-needs-to-continue"><a name="the-assumption-that-human-life-needs-to-continue">The
Assumption that Human Life Needs to Continue</a></h2>
<p>Within our culture are ideas that pervade and eventually influence
the recollection of thinkers, who might not realize how they would use
those ideas later, unreflectively.</p>
<p>One such idea is that humanity needs to continue, which seems to be
due to messaging from entertainment, and a modern feeling that the world
has a commonality or a globalness, which needs perpetuation. This
feeling could not have existed at a time prior to very recent times, as
earlier there was not such a feeling that humanity collectively ought to
persist indefinitely, as a group in which all are happy to belong
together somehow, at least in this context of this type of thinking.</p>
<p>It is an odd view, considering people do not plan to coexist in any
afterlife. Not wanting to coexist in an afterlife, for some reason, they
think there ought to be some people living after us, who would somehow
represent everyone who is now living, creating a kind of coexistence in
the after death.</p>
<p>We don’t live after we die, and somehow this gets overlooked. Even
when young, I recall some friends insisting that there is not too much
reason to care after death because they would not be alive. At that
time, I was somewhat dismissive of that view, because I thought that one
ought to behave in a way that contributes to betterment of the future
somehow, but in retrospect, I think their point is one that must be
considered and taken quite seriously, because not only does an
individual not need to have children that would live into the future to
continue such betterment (under obligations created), but no people need
to exist or have children in the future, if that is not wanted.</p>
<p>Notice if the earth’s population were reduced by natural disaster,
and all died all but a few thousand Chinese and Indian populations, that
their choice, the choice of the Chinese and Indians to have more
childre, would not result in children who would really carry on for you.
If you are these Chinese or Indian people, you still have a choice as to
whether to have children or not and there is no special obligation to do
anything in particular because everyone else has died. Furthermore, a
short time later, the children may wish strongly to depart from the ways
or cancel contributions of their parents, and certainly they would
forget them.</p>
<p>The assumption that humanity needs to continue is one that is
irrational and has harmful consequences. Certainly, a child born from
the side effects of sexual desires of parents, and more rarely, plans
that are mental and unrecorded, and as a rule, sketchy and incomplete
and also irrational in vision, does not have any responsibility for
having children of their own.</p>
<p>There is no obligation on any child born that they later must
reproduce. Most know this at one time, but then on other occasions,
think, on social grounds, that pressure to have children is something
worth doing. Decisions as to whether it is worthwhile to have children,
certainly would want to consider whether the person would want kids, and
what the later effects of not wanting them would have on the parenting
process.</p>
<p>There is no law that exists that states that people may not remain
single for life; a child born, may find life something worth having,
only if they can remain single.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Any person now, who thinks there is an obligation to have children,
will have no foundation for such a belief. It is a bias which has come
into mind from culture in entertainment. There is no obligation in
total, for any species to continue.</p>
<p>I think some might feel strongly that there is, but if they reflect
they will see truly, it is a bias and they have no foundation whatsoever
for that view.</p>
<p>It is not clear what continuation of humanity would do for me. It’s
not clear what it would do for anyone in particular. It is not clear
what it would do for everyone taken in total.</p>
<p>Collective selfishness about a need for some few people to exist
later, without any thinking about how anyone benefits who lives seems
really odd.</p>
<p>It’s almost like mostly everyone has chosen to dismiss the benefits
to the living in the same way I did when I was a kid. Probably I
inherited the bias.</p>
<p>What are some of the harms of this bias:</p>
<ul>
<li>Indiscriminate child-having and rationalization afterwards.
<ul>
<li>“I’m helping the world carry on.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Selfish peer pressure to have children regardless of situation.</li>
<li>Selfish ideas about carrying on for everyone with one’s baby.
<ul>
<li>“American children will extend the legacy of China.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Stupidity around what really benefits a person.</li>
<li>Taking credit for the lives of children, while not being willing to
receive responsibility for negatives about their lives.</li>
<li>Inability to know that creation of human life can be a negative
contribution.</li>
<li>Adoption of extra-religious grounds in “survival” by those who think
they didn’t adopt a social-evolutionary worldview.</li>
</ul>
<p>Arguing with someone committed to this view, I think eventually they
realize they have no foundation and simply become committed to the
assumptions.</p>

<p>Thinking about now, it’s really hard to know who is a good actor in

self-forgetfulness in watching, but observing others who watch the same
films and other films, I think they get absorbed in garbage too. There
are very few movie moments that I would say are really amazing, and
those movie moments are not only the actor but editing and direction,
and cinematography. And this guy definitely doesn’t have an scenes I
would consider being good at the level that he could be analyzed for
separation from his production team. “It’s just bad so it seems they all

<p>A limitation of self-publication for self, or on blogs or sites for
others, is that there is a limiation on what content can be produced
depending on the mind. Readers don’t exist and so won’t see what the
very best minds have recorded and that’s not yours, given your inability
to record.</p>
<p>But suppose you write books, since you surely don’t write sites. As
an author, your book will be plain, mostly a copy of what has already
been done before so far as formatting and sectioning goes, and your
content will likely contain few truths, analyzing sentences correctly
and logically, with a need for long sentences to get to even a passable
level of truth.</p>
<p>Now your mediocre book which is mostly all books is placed into the
library for <em>storage</em>. Reading rates are low. I don’t only mean
few are reading, and that few research, and seek out books that are not
new enough to be in bookstores with limited shelving, but that library
of congress has mostly untouched volumes.</p>
<p>Seeing and well-knowing that large bookshelves, tall and wide, with
ladders and so on, and seemingly unlimited options, does not really make
it aesthetic, on a later more mature view. These books are unread. Most
are poor. Reading is slow, even when readers claim to be quick. I know
this firsthand. My reading rate also is not incredible, but has allowed
me to read, many volumes, while others pretend, and have volumes for
show, and for telling lies later.</p>
<p>People don’t read but have books.</p>
<p>Libraries hold books unread.</p>
<p>The books that are there are mediocre.</p>
<p>How does the library retain that beauty you thought it had, when you
see it and know, it is unused unworthy material, largely.</p>
<p>Libraries do not have a timeless appeal that people think they do, in
a consistent way. There can be no expectation of seeing beauty in
libraries. I like to have access to books that I will read, but when I
observe the library, I recall I want one or two books at a time, and one
hundred thousand volumes of false statements, unread by others, and I
now think that is not really beautiful.</p>
<p>Beautiful inefficiencies “abhorred by nature” as the saying goes?</p>
<p>What is efficient in nature in conveying experience for learning?</p>
<p>An attraction to books for me was somewhat the material, but more the
smells, and the paper and the feel of books. But this is paper.</p>
<p>This is not a commentary on my dislike for books, because I like them
especially and that is an unusual trait.</p>
<p>The library is unusually empty and that doesn’t make for a beautiful
library in a way.</p>
<p>People share photos of large older libraries with many volumes in
historic locations, and people enjoy. I’ve enjoyed. But it’s suboptimal
nature so maybe what is enjoyed is furniture, and knowing you have</p>
<p>two or three books you might read eventually in a lifetime.</p>

<p>A typology would be required to clarify this. Suppose I’m a professor
and I’m charismatically telling the truth and am giving away great
information freely, with an expectation that learning is personal. That
is a kind of leadership, that is more devoid of manipulation, and can
exist in a range of other contexts, including parenting. Then there is
leadership knowing that people or children won’t decide in their best
interests for a large amount of situations. Being informed is then a
risk. Not being informed of plans implies manipulation, but not with
malintent. The same person can utilize different strategies for
situations and roles. Within this I think a classification can exist
that would allow people to identify which is which, and have a shared
vocabulary.</p>

id="higher-order-attention-notes"><a name="higher-order-attention-notes">Higher
Order Attention, Notes</a></h2>
<p>Currently in progress is my work on Higher Order Attention, a topic
that I’ve already written about in my <a href="">Dark Green
Notebook</a>. The handwritten book needs editing, and some additions and
improvements, before it can be republished as a complete mini-book or
long article. The purpose of the book is to describe a method and
strategy in which people can improve their lives by altering their
attention, which includes subjects which might seem unrelated, like
choosing a place to live and location away from people who are harmful
or would utilze your attention in ways that are not in your best
interest. So it touches on spaces and time and not only attempts at
ignoring specific experiences, or trying to find better things to put
one’s attention on.</p>
<p>Here I’m wanting to include some notes on social irritants and some
connecting strategies to mitigate or alleviate unwated effects.</p>
<p>I’ve attained a level of fame in my life such that I’m recognized
wherever I go, and people, for whatever reason, enjoy tying to
invalidate the supposed claims they pretend I’m committed to, translated
poorly from various sources in my social media. In other words, they
lock hold of things they think they can use to irriate me.</p>
<p>A fascinating side effect of this is that it does test my work on
higher order attention, to an extent. That work is not for unusual
circumstances really. It’s more of a strategy which can be used under a
variety of circumstances tha are not by design strange or retaliatory.
The point of the work is not to help every situation, but to define a
strategy that does work, for many scenarios, that is needed and
currently doesn’t exist. In other words, I do have unusual circumstances
but these circumstances to not imply that what does not exist for
anyone, that is more challenging for some, is debunked because of the
some (the exceptions).</p>
<p>Anyway, it is of interest that I can refine this article and strategy
on the basis of my experiences which are more demanding and not less.
The items below pertain to current attempts on attention and
distraction.</p>
<p>Social irritants are the primary method used by others for trying to
take attention, in a way they think is meaningful, or humorous, or
satisfying to them for a variety of disturbing reasons. Everyone has
some familiarity with some of these having been children, stuck in
places with other children, fighting verbally, or with any method which
might cause discomfort. Thinking back to when one is a kid, one can come
up with many annoying things that one can do, to distract or otherwise
annoy, and consume attention of others.</p>
<p>The items I’ve placed below are things that a child might do, but
what I experience is adults doing these same behaviors.</p>
<ul>
<li>Speaking with a strange voice:
<ul>
<li>Strange tones</li>
<li>Irregular rhythms</li>
<li>Rhythms matching heartbeats or other rhythms</li>
<li>Abrupt statements</li>
<li>Whispers with jarring words, or items about you</li>
<li>Threats in any of the voices or whispers</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Mixing you into conversations:
<ul>
<li>Information about you intermixed with regular conversation</li>
<li>Stating things about you, or relating things to you while pretending
nothing is about you</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Saying things about you which might provoke:
<ul>
<li>Abrupt random statements about what might cause an emotional
response</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Pretend control or dominance
<ul>
<li>Prompting a reaction in you then noting they were the cause</li>
<li>Prompting a reaction they say they can use, making you an employee
or worker of theirs</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Ganging up, collective bullying and nuisance/harassment
<ul>
<li>Targeted teasing or piquing in group</li>
<li>Group change of volume, high or low</li>
<li>Group feigned reactions to you, or whatever is attributed to you by
them first. (I.e. they say something that relates to you, then pretend
you’re not there or you do not relate, then they as a group reactive
negatively to what was said, to make it seem as though you were suddenly
rejected. But they simply said something, pretended you didn’t relate,
then pretended to all have a negative social judgement on it).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Laughter
<ul>
<li>Irritating or jarring false laughter</li>
<li>Laughter that seems like it would be connected with mischief or
teaing, or resulting from harms of others.</li>
<li>Laughter that is simply annoying and doesn’t include you, or is to
indicate you’re not included</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Pretend involvement
<ul>
<li>Some will pretend to know you, or pretend to have knowledge of your
activities, and pretend to contribute, be knowledgeable about those
behaviors, or critique what is being worked on at the moment, while it
is being done.</li>
<li>Pretend self-crediting while obstructing.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Pretend “I got you.”
<ul>
<li>“I caught you doing _____.”</li>
<li>“You’re panicking, crying, etc…” Another way of saying “I got you”
or, “I caused your feeling and I cuaght it” or “You’re weak” etc…</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Invented junk criticisms, slang, etc… Akin to “gamer win” speak.
<ul>
<li>Slang used by teens when believed victorious, even if not. Simply
used whenever. A way of claiming perpetual winning. Christian “victory”
used against others.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Pretend Justification that keeps changing.
<ul>
<li>“I’m doing this because of __________.”</li>
<li>“I’m going to do this until ___________.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Talking dumb or slow, when not.
<ul>
<li>Sarcastic “I’m dumb”. (even if true).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Stressed voice, or voice to grab attention
<ul>
<li>Especially among women. Used to get your attention, or to manipulate
you into having a feeling they don’t actually have, but are pretending.
Acting distressed, using a stressed voice, causing you stress that they
don’t have! Somewhat like a child trying to get something from a parent,
by causing a readiness or desire to help.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Act that you’re going to be in.
<ul>
<li>This is a harassment method intended to create a cause at damaging
you through others. People will create an act and pretend it includes
you as a negative character, or try to get you to become involved, in
order to make you involved with whoever else will be brought in. This
may allow denial of services, and use of law enforcement in false
ways.</li>
<li>Preteding you’re a risk, so that they can later take actions on that
assumption. This can be done in many ways. They’ll choose on the basis
of what garners unreflective support.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><em>There are many other methods which can be added later but they
are not inexhaustible. There is really a total number of irritating
things which can be done</em></p>
<p>Reactions to these statements are the symptoms they hope to inflict
upon you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Thinking about what you would otherwise not think about</li>
<li>Time distraction from other activities or thoughts</li>
<li>Involuntary facial reactions</li>
<li>Involuntary reactions in breathing</li>
<li>Involuntary reactions in other bodily feelings or sensations</li>
<li>Creation of unwanted imagery</li>
<li>Distress and crying</li>
<li>Submission</li>
<li>Creating competition</li>
</ul>
<p>Even those items above which you think you might not experience, can
be gauranteed nearly over time or with enough negative stimulation using
the methods above. Even if one thinks “I’m strong and I would not
submit,” one will still have thoughs, which might be perturbing, even if
very brief, that would related to placation or an understanding that the
expected behavior is placation, or supplication or begging, etc… When
harassment has been very great I have had ideas come to mind which were
from others in origin. Another method is to include in teasing or
irritating behavior suggestions for thoughts which you will then later
have, or nearly have, or recall—any of which can be intensely
aggravating, even if you do not at all show it in outward
expression.</p>
<p><em>There are many other reactions which can be added later.</em></p>
<p>Many of these items can be dealt with using some easy techniques,
which I have not mastered myself. I utilize many methods which do cause
success, and I definitely do a great job in my circumstances, but that
is also because of a history in childhood of being a dominant child and
not being one easily subject to bullying. So I’m not really especially
easy to damage using these attacks. However the attacks are very
frequent in my case, like what might occur to a targeted celebrity, who
has no place to hide really, who spends a lot of time in public. Some of
these methods will surely be useful to others. I’m recording them here
for myself primarily though, so I more quickly grab a partcular solution
and apply it to what it resolves or alleviates, without being lazy about
it, or forgetting which reaction resolves which stimulation.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Intense concentration on task into flow.</em>
<ul>
<li>This may be the best option of all because it does create a
mentality in which nearly anything which is not totally strange and
socially unacceptable from others can be ignored. This is equivalent to
going into a daydreaming mode, in which the world is blurred out, and
what is focused on is focused on very intensely.</li>
<li>For me this is achiveable when writing or doing work on the
computer, which may also involve my speaking to myself in my mind, or
vocalizing in my mind what I’m writing.</li>
<li>Drawback: This cannot be maintined easily for more than a few hours,
and I don’t think most would be able to maintain it even that long.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Rhythmic voicing matching a rhythm in the environment.
<ul>
<li>Matching rhythm that is meaningless or retaliatory, even if
inaudible to others.</li>
<li>Strength: This is really easy to just continue for very long
periods.</li>
<li>Drawback: Can cause you to overutilize it, when one of the other
reactions is a better antidote for what is happening.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Sound decibel matching.</em>
<ul>
<li>If someone suddenly gets more loud than a situation calls for, can
match their loudness. That corresponds to a social rule. As others
become loud you’ll notice others join in, and this alternates with lulls
and quieter moments.</li>
<li>Drawback: There are situations in which people would still use this
to pretend you were the odd person out. I.e. you were causing problems
with noise, as if they were not the causes, or because they are
unreflective and do not know their own behavior.</li>
<li>Strength: It creates a feeling of increased power and decreases
reactivity to what is done. It dulls what people are doing and may be
somewhat akin to what is felt when someone is realizing they are
winning.</li>
<li>Drawback: Engages you in competition you may not want. Although it
may be possible to internalize that this is simply an antidote and
remove the feeling that one is being forced into competition.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Giving no harasser any special respect, social position, or
sympathy</em>, given that they will utilize that to harm you. This when
someone who is harassing is oddly hunched, or diseased, old, young, or
other. Famous people really do deal with comments that are negative from
every kind of person, including people you wouldn’t expect harmful
things from. This is dangerous as one might want to feel some special
kindness for a person, then find they are wanting to damage you.
<ul>
<li>Some might read this, and claim you cannot diminish your kindness.
Anyone who is subject to harassment over a period would know, however,
that the reactions which are antidotes to affects you will experience
from attacks, ought to successfully support you. Sometimes you need to
really simply do what is necessary to thwart attack, and these people
are not respecting you anyway.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>More brief list with less detail:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sudden vigorous exercise (causes concentration and allows for
controling ones internal environment).</li>
<li>Any change of posture, or standing walking, stretching.</li>
<li>Talking to oneself (in mind or quietly aloud).</li>
<li>Working and being absorbed.</li>
<li>Showing strength. (with detachment is something I aim at, to not
have related feelings with showing strength).</li>
<li>Noise blocking, matching, covering, etc…</li>
<li>Having music on (sometimes there are numerous irritations happening
at different volumes and tones, and rhythms. Music may not eliminate
all, but eliminate much.</li>
<li>Meditating.</li>
</ul>
<p>The harder ones over time to eliminate or alleviate:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ones with semantic properties that jolt your thinking into a place
that is stressful to the person targeted in particular. I’m not realy
sensitive on many topics, and do not believe myself an easy target at
all using this. However, I think this implies some others would be in
very great danger if targeted in the same way, if they are merely
sensitive in many ways, or if they lived private lives, and have too
many secrets which can somehow get picked at over time, with doxxing,
testing and using, and other techniques. In my case, I have noticed that
understanding what is said, will cut through many methods of ignoring.
If someone just blurts out to you something personal to you very
suddenly in public, while pretending you’re not there, you will probably
notice, and be somewhat affected, even if you’re able to ignore most
everything else that is more meaningless. Simply ignoring works well
except when the meaning somehow relates to something which is more
irritating, even if just at that time, in that mood.
<ul>
<li>This is best targeted I’ve found with working in flow. But flow is
not something that is necessarily an option quickly, for just before or
after that might happen. One may not know, and probably will not know,
in order to get into a mindset that is less susceptible. However, if one
is going to be in an environment where this can be anticipated, working
for a long period will cause those attacks to be more blunted, during
that time.</li>
<li>Talking to oneself about a topic of interest for a long period of
time (aloud or as I usually do, simply in my own mind), that allows you
to have a conversation with yourself. Notice that conversations with
others cause one to not hear much of what is going on around, if the
conversation is good enough. This is like doing the same kind of thing,
only alone. This technique is related to the flow in work technique, and
while I’m not quite in a flow right now, I’m working and verbalizing to
myself, in a way that is focused and interested and it does blunt
incoming irritations.</li>
</ul></li>

id="exploring-distance-to-town-in-provisioning-of-the-camping-traveler-and-the-homeless."><a name="exploring-distance-to-town-in-provisioning-of-the-camping-traveler-and-the-homeless">Exploring
distance to town, in provisioning of the camping traveler and the
homeless.</a></h2>
<p>In a recent posting I came to the idea that distance to a quality
sleep location, which might be determined on a sleep quality index,
might be used to determine some key issues blocking the fixing of
homelessness and related travel discomforts. It was considered that
travel indecisiveness even among those who have wealth appears related
to the lack of a market fulfilling sleep needs, in a way that would
place high quality sleep locations ranking well on a sleep quality
index, closer to a traveler at any particular time. If this issue is
resolved for the homeless in a way that is satisfactory for their well
being and dignity then it can be presumed that the dignity would imply a
solution of good enough quality to be utilized by wealthy travelers who
just want sleep too.</p>
<p>Here though I want to develop the topic from the other direction. I
still want to find an inexpensive and natural environment to camp that
is near a city location where I can enjoy various businesses, but easily
access my sleep location shortly afterwards. This of course is the
flipside of the earlier issue. If one did have a good sleep location or
camp site as a traveler or as a homeless person, and one is doing well,
is clean, and is safe, one would still get bored vary quickly. When I
imagine sleeping in a tent, in a campsite location in any national park,
in the rain, I do not imagine it to be pleasant. Worse is the issue of
what you do when you are exhausted and need to recover, and have nothing
to do, and have hours or days ahead in a tent. People already do not
wish to be at home too long; after a few days, it will be very
attractive to leave the house and visit a business and see people. It
would be much worse in a tent, in poor weather over an extended period,
with very few “amenitites” if one could call comforts such a thing at a
camp site, and one would quickly want to see people, and enjoy various
businesses in town.</p>
<p>For my own travel and lifestyle interests this may be as big of an
issue nearly as the sleep issue. Because even if I find a location that
is comfortable to sleep outside the city, in a location that is not too
far away, I will not want to stay there long. Which does illuminate
another reason why the sleep issue needs to be resolved: people really
just want to sleep, they don’t necessarily want to go anywhere. It’s
somewhat humorous to think that sleep implies travel. This is again
where the homeless person is linked with the traveler.</p>
<p>One way to resolve this is to have plenty to do while camping at the
camp location, if the camp location is one that can be stayed at during
the day and not only at night. It may be that being in a tent overnight
in a location is suitable because it isn’t so visible; but during the
day, it may be subject to potential detection, and in that case, one
will have to move, if one can, depending on the weather. But if one can
stay, one can simply have plenty to do, sitting outside the tent, or
nearby, or sitting in the tent. This to me still sounds a bit
ridiculous, as sitting in a tent for a long period of time is like
choosing to have very little space and visibility in an open
environment. So I suppose I would want to stay out of the tent anytime
the weather is good enough and I’m not at risk of excessive sun
exposure, or other. I do enjoy solitary life, so reading is totally
acceptable for a long period. If in network range it may be possible to
use the internet, accomplish work, or play games and so on. One could
easily exercise nearby, hike and observe nature, and take photographs,
or do art if one liked.</p>
<p>But how long does it take to get bored when doing this?</p>
<p>Camping in a tent seems to be somethign that is only tolerable in one
single spot for a day or two, unless one can leave the tent behind and
drive into town. If one is on a hiking trip, then it makes sense that it
would be enjoyable to hike each day, and set up camp in a new and
exciting place every night. For most people, camping in one location for
a very long time might not be too comfortable. Continuing the hike keeps
things interesting and gives one something to do.</p>
<p>It seems odd that there would be a requirement in backpacking that
for enjoyment one might have to continue moving, even if in nature in
locations where camping is easy and one is well provisioned. If one
wasn’t moving, one would probably not want to camp, and go into
town.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>It may be of interest here to research life outside of the market in
our history. We know that people preferred to be somewhat near town
centers in order to have access to goods and necessities, and at a
reasonable price. However, others have lived rural lives at fairly great
distances from supplies, and in western life in the United States, there
is the idea that people enjoyed trips into town as periodic
entertainment, which may happen only weekly or biweekly or monthly. Some
may have spent much longer periods of time away, living as homesteaders
and so on. What I don’t know is how comfortable that was, and how able
one was at keeping oneself occupied and happy. The dwelling structures
that people would have lived in in these scenarios would have included
some shift from the market to the homeplace for entertainment. In other
words, things are at home that are enjoyable that could be elsewhere.
I.e. “I’m keeping books and games at home, and more possesions that have
the purpose of keeping me free from excessive boredom.” Tenting does not
allow for the same level of self-satisfaction as having a home, but
maybe with technology and so on it allows for even more in some ways,
than what was available in a cabin, or small home in the country. Except
now there is some need for obtaining energy, which again pushes one to
need to visit town.</p>
<p>For a very long period in my life I could read most of the day and be
contented. Now however, I do not wish to read for nearly as long. It
feels as though I’ve read enough and having a book in my face for more
than a few hours is excessive. So I have to quickly think of other
things to do, but most do seem to involve a screen. Using a screen I
will need to return to town to get a charge.</p>
<p>There is a definite need to find a location to sleep that is in a
safe location outside of town. But then there is an interesting question
about why you don’t just stay there. It’s an odd question to ask,
because it’s not unusual to stay at home for very long periods of time
and people don’t really need to ask themselves why they would stay at
home, where they are paying excessive amounts of rent, whether they stay
or leave. But if the objective is sleep (and for me it is largely for
sleep even if I do have a home, or a hotel room, which seems more
aligned to sleep needs), then when one is finished sleeping it’s not
clear why one would remain in the same spot.</p>
<p>“Why are you staying in that one spot renter, or homeowner, if the
goal was sleep?”</p>
<p>My ex-wife and I would spend most of our time outside of the house,
doing things at the gym, at the coffeehouse, eating at restaurants and
so on, and would not spend too much time home. Later one vacations. In
all this time away, payments are still made for the home. But for us,
the home really did mostly represent sleep and relaxation, in a high
quality location, which would score very well on a sleep location
quality index.</p>
<p>“What if a tent were as nice as your home?”</p>
<p>This sounds like an impossibilty clearly. But playing imaginatively,
what if you had a pop-up tent that had everything and was the size of a
large studio apartment. It is in a box like an inflatable raft, which
can be quite large. You pull the cable and the whole thing pops up, and
provides you a very nice and secure shelter with all you need, including
electronics and entertainment, and place to sleep. It is a portable
hotel room, of high quality.</p>
<p>In such a case would it not seem that the tent is becoming the same
as the home?</p>
<p>But the tent is not the home. It has to be something that can be
carried on one’s back. A home, on the other hand is immovable, and stays
in one place. In between this is the hotel room, which may be scattered
about in various locations, somewhat close to a city center.</p>
<p>In my future plans I do want to reside in a hotel the way I did when
I was a travelling consultant. But I also want to be able to camp as
well. There is still an issue in that hotels are not really distributed
as well as one might think, and they might be overpriced and booked. A
backpack is always with you, meaning you can throw a tent out anywhere,
excepting for prohibitions by rules. In between this would be that
market for sleep I was talking about that would provide more structures
of various types that would score well on a sleep location quality
index. But wouldn’t these start to seem like that tent that has
everything I just mentioned, if the product were designed really well.
There are pods and so on that have been created, and these ideas for 3d
printing of homeless dwellings, and many other kinds of portable
structures. But what is missing is the existence of these structures in
a market where you can really use them.</p>
<p>Such structures initially would be geared to sleep. But they seem
like the would also develop later to solve issues of boredom.</p>
<p>“Now you’re done sleeping in your pod. Get out and find something to
do…”</p>
<p>This doesn’t seem reasonable either. Maybe you need to lay around,
and read, and maybe have some basic VR entertainment, or something that
would expand the function of that sleep dwelling a positive way, that
would enable people to occupy their time when they are not sure what
else to do.</p>
<p>The sleep location also seems to be a location where other activities
for resolving boredome take place. Of course there is sexual bahavior.
But there is also just laying and daydreaming comfortably, and reading,
and playing on an electronic device.</p>
<p>This would assist with homelessness too because their behaviors would
be channeled towards forms of enjoyment and entertainment that are
positive, rather than perhaps doing other things which might be related
to criminal behavior, or self-injurious behaviors like drug abuse.</p>
<p>Not expecting or anticipating such a market to open in the near
future, I think to myself now that I may need to find a way to make my
camping plans include maximum positive self-entertainment and comfort
for more than one or two days in one location. Because even if I resolve
the issue of finding a place to sleep in a nice natural environment not
unreasonably far to walk to/from a city or town center, I will need to
find a way to make that same location one that can be stayed at for a
prolonged period of time. If that goal was completed, and really the
camp location was comfortable and enjoyable much like inside a home,
then it should begin to seem homelike. Some of the smaller experiences
of comfort, which fall within user experience in using various products,
should become part of the camping. If not, it may be that camping really
is infeasible. And I admit I have never really enjoyed camping in my
life too much. But I also don’t like spending thousands a month on
rent.</p>
<p>It seems to me that if camping is only for sleep it is entirely
feasible.</p>
<p>If camping is supposed to take the role of a hotel room, then I think
it may not be feasible.</p>
<p>There are other serious issues like making biological needs that are
recurring transparent to the daily experience. I can run into the
restroom and use it and hardly reflect that I’m using it, if I’m at a
hotel room. But in a camping scenario, there are many things which make
urination alone somewhat impossible to be totally ingnorable. For
example, one risks urinating on oneself in a tent. There is no sink.
Leaving the tent over and over and over to urinate is really annoying.
It does not take long before one is really wondering whether that is
worthwhile.</p>
<p>However, there was a time before bathrooms. So what does it take to
return to that period in mind, to have the same level of comfort that
would have then existed.</p>
<p>Where can I be out of view when I urinate? Defecation is an issue
too, but I leave it out because urination alone is enough to rule the
whole thing out over time.</p>
<p>Whenever I was camping, or using my RV, even in my RV with a very
nice bathroom, I was inclined to want to save up to avoid defecation. I
would prefer to find a restroom somewhere, at a cheap gym or at a gas
station, or other business. This is not really feasible for comfort over
a very long period of time either. I was able to overcome it for van
camping and traveling, but I don’t foresee making it comfortable for
camping in a tent.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>In this posting I have not covered the various other reasons for
going into town:</p>
<ul>
<li>I want to see people.</li>
<li>I want to sit in a comfortable climate and drink a coffee.</li>
<li>I want to use nice restroom.</li>
<li>I want to feel normal. (which is a hard to define and requires
definition, because it can be overcome in specifics).</li>
<li>I like these various goods on a daily basis: groceries, drinks,
…</li>
<li>I want to exercise at a gym.</li>
</ul>
<p>If it is not too far to find a place to sleep from a city location
with these services, then it may not be too hard to return to the city
on a daily business too to fulfill each of these needs. My earlier
requirement on remaining in one location for a period of time, near or
at the sleep location, might still be fulfillable, if that period of
time is only a day or two at a maximum, and the time to get back into
the city is short enough.</p>
<p>This means that all market desires are fulfillable. One is
comfortable in one spot for a period in the same way as “down time” at
home. Most don’t have down time for more than a few days on average, if
I’m not mistaken (and I could be, and am if everyone on earth is
considered). Suburban people in the United States might be a good
representative group. One can easily get from the market back to sleep
and the sleep is high enough quality. If this scenario is doable then I
would argue that it’s pretty close to fulfilling the needs of many
travelers and homeless people, and myself as someone who would like to
camp periodically and avoid unnecessary expenditure.</p>
<p>In the earlier post, I was saying that choice of location and region
would be necessary to enable this. This is a research problem then
perhaps. Being a research problem it means I can solve it for myself,
but others would not necessarily be able to do the same, or they would
be like me in their willingness to do this. This implies it does not
solve homeless issues, but it does solve issues for a class of travlers
and some homeless. The extent to which it is feasible depends on what
reserach would reveal about the total quantity of locations available in
which this would work, and how widely distribute they are, and where
they are. Just the spatial constraints on this particular solution.</p>
<p>Even before going back, I’m certain this would work right now in
Flagstaff, Arizona. This would be an examplar locaiton potentially of
where this would be possible. Research seems like it would be on towns
and cities, and not at all on countryside. Towns that are very small may
be good candidates though. This means research is about the relationship
of land areas to town locations, in what uses are permitted, and the
quality of the landscape and market resources for people who would want
to live this way.</p>
<p>Next I think what I might do is create a set of requirements for both
the traveller of my type and for the homeless, and for city locations on
impacts to people who live nearby. Using this I will perhaps be able to
overcome what nuissance laws happen to be, and maybe find a way to make
it impossible for complaints to break the solution. Where there can be
no complaints is ideal for now, but I want the solution to start to move
towards locations where people could complain. If I can find the legal
method to make such complaints impossible if behaviors and impacts are
within tolerances, then I think I’m closer to a more complete solution
to homelessness and needs of travelers.</p>
<p>Then perhaps I can find a solution to: “Why can’t I camp in an
airport?”.</p>

id="factors-in-basic-travel-and-homeless-life-provisioning-continued."><a name="factors-in-basic-travel-and-homeless-life-provisioning-continued">Factors
in basic travel and homeless life provisioning, continued.</a></h2>
<p>In the last post I listed some factors or important areas of interest
for developing a more clear analysis of related problems of travel and
homelessness.</p>
<p>Travel and homelessness are extremely related although for a variety
of reasons that is not brought up in discussions on solving homelessness
problems in the media.</p>
<p>Before moving on to focusing on more factors, it may be of interest
to list some parallels between the two briefly. The second to most
recent posting goes into detail on some some relationships, and may be
worth exploring.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Sleep Disallowed</em>. Even wealthy people are prevented
entirely from being able to sleep at airports, even if they are at risk
in various ways.</li>
<li><em>Demands on Decision Making</em>. Beginning and Experienced
travelers experience indecision, or a threat of excess demand on
decision making, to find accommodations that are acceptable and
safe/comfortable.</li>
<li><em>No Market for Sleep or Cleanliness</em>. Related to the above,
when traveling, suddenly one feels that basics are not available. Even a
wealthy person may not have a place to simply defecate or urinate, or
sleep. And money might not be able to buy it (i.e. Airport sleep
accommodations).</li>
<li><em>Odd Requirement to Move Around</em>. One cannot remain in a
location too long without drawing attention and eventual expulsion.
Expulsion happens quickly.</li>
<li><em>Distance to comforts</em>. Suddenly there is a great distance to
comforts. There is a market for this but one has to have funds and
either way, the time loss is felt. Consider time from the airport to a
hotel room, or home.</li>
<li><em>Requirement to look or behave in a way that is not a nuisance to
</em>someone.** Anyone can face a random complaint from someone who is
in a bad mood, or has a poor character or disposition. A kind and clean
homeless person can simply be victim to a habitual complainer, and even
become a suspect to various unsolved crimes. A wealthy person who may
already be of public interest can be slandered and defamed nearly
anywhere and face false accusations for gaining attention.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many other relationships that I think are more fundamental.
This list didn’t do a great job at pinpointing the problem. When anyone
leaves home, they are suddenly a traveler. A vagrant, or a transitional
tourist, or transient. I’ve mentioned it appears we’ve arranged a
system, somehow, discouraging anything but destination focused travel,
by implementing various market omissions and by ensuring discomforts. It
explains why you really cannot sleep anywhere but someplace that
resembles a final destination. A home or a hotel. It explains why
closing your eyes is something that makes it appear you are a homeless
person, unless you are unusually well dressed and exhibitionist about
wealth. You may be allowed to sleep at a location, if you are dressed
like an official in the military, or if you are wearing only luxury
branded clothing, obviously marked as such, and of good quality. Anyone
else dressed even somewhat nicely will be get odd looks if their eyes
close. I wonder if this is another reason for the existence of an
aftermarket for, or market imitating, military goods. If you dress like
you are in the military, even cheaply, you may also have some protection
from being judged transient or homeless.</p>
<p>There is also a view that you need to keep moving. You cannot stop
anywhere too long, unless again, it is something that is like a final
destination, or a homelike place that would clearly fit on an itinerary.
Then there is love of itineraries and sharing of plans. You are supposed
to have plans as though travel cannot be just how you live.</p>
<p>Camping resembles what is considered a public nuisance already, of
aggregation of homeless people. The difference is where it is happening.
Tent villages really are identical with camping, where the tent villages
are well kept, and where duration and intents are similar. Consider if
you are a backpacker, and you are in an urban environment. If you were
to choose a place not too far to sleep, using your gear, you would be a
tent villager of one. If a group of National Park enthusiasts who
happened to be enjoying an detour through an urban area decided to join
you, seeing your example, they too would be building your village. From
the start you were a nuisance like a hobo, and with a larger group, a
larger nuisance. Except now like the homeless, you might be able to
fight collectively for a time if anyone causes issue. “This is not a
location for camping tourism…” might be fought off successfully. So just
as with the homeless, individuals, like you, are more at risk of being
unable to defend. But that’s how many travel who travel often. “Before
you have a family, make sure to do your traveling.” The implication is
that you are individual, and perhaps more at risk. If this is the case,
that you are more at risk, then there would be no time that travel would
be more acceptable, for anything that at all resembles homelessness. But
backpacking resembles homelessness.</p>
<p>Right now I’m at a Starbucks, and beside me I have a stuffed
backpack, that is higher quality and more expensive than usual, which
helps a bit. But either way, it is a backpack that backpackers carry.
Now, I’m in an urban environment. Can I use it as it is intended to be
used, to utilize my gear that would attach and be stowed in various
ways, here or many places for long? Well in an urban setting, it became
a normal travel bag. Just an option to a carry-on. Outside the urban
area there are long expanses of locations where it is uncertain as to
the legality of sleep, or long distances to paid camping locations where
people are oddly clustered together, hardly remote in nature. Camping
backpacks have two very separate purposes. One is to support very
specific back country hiking trips that are supposed to be contained.
You depart and return to your home. The second purpose is, as I already
stated, for normal travel. But then it’s a strange design for normal
travel. Now you appear a hobo/camper in an urban setting. “How long
exactly are you going to be here?”</p>
<p>I think there may be some expectation that you have reasonable need
to stay somewhere slightly longer if you have such a bag though. There
may be some benefit. But the bag cannot be disgusting, and can’t be
unsightly. However, it is also an indicator that you may stay too long.
It is also a sign you are a vagrant or transient, or may not have a
place to go. Contrast this with a business traveler carrying few things
except maybe a slim computer bag. You can sit places quite a long time
anyway with that appearance, and people may not notice you even
remained. It appears you do not intend to remain, and that you have some
place to go. You cannot be adequately prepared to try to live like a
homeless person. But a person who is backpacking in an urban environment
is equipped precisely to live self-sufficiently, or at least has what
appears to be ready for that same purpose (obviously a backpack may not
have what is needed within it).</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The topic I was planning to focus on a bit more, but did not, was on
complaints that would relate to criminal nuisance. I have not researched
this much. Being a landowner of a large parcel of land, with a
trespasser issue, this is of interest. Humorously the trespassers are
like vagrant wealthy people at times, unruly and certainly behaving as a
nuisance. There is no way to remove them given the way law is not
enforced in the countryside, even near to Anchorage. In Anchorage,
however, I think public nuisance laws are enforced. Right now though I’m
in Nevada, where public nuisance events really do occur probably with
more frequency. I found a law, and some examples provided, which
included language like “vagrant resorts”. Here’s the law:</p>
<p><strong>Nevada Crimes and Punishments</strong></p>
<p><em>Sec. 202.470</em></p>
<p>Maintaining or permitting nuisance: Penalty.</p>
<p>Every person who:</p>
<p>1.Shall commit or maintain a public nuisance, for which no special
punishment is prescribed; or 1.Shall willfully omit or refuse to perform
any legal duty relating to the removal of such nuisance; or 1.Shall let,
or permit to be used, any building or boat, or portion thereof, knowing
that it is intended to be, or is being used, for committing or
maintaining any such nuisance,</p>
<ul>
<li>shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.</li>
</ul>
<p>The vagueness of this law makes it more obvious why the homelessness
issue seems unresolvable. Too many things can be complained about. Take
any person from the community and ask them what the scope of nuisance
behavior is and they won’t really know. Ask them about what they would
do if they were a traveler or a homeless person in an urban environment,
needing to sleep, and whether that behavior would constitute nuisance
behavior, they wouldn’t know. Ask them if they could urinate or defecate
in public, if they were at a point that it would become involuntary,
they would not know. Ask them if they can vomit in public, if they feel
ill, they would not know. But for each of these things, people really
can become victims of police interrogation and even arrest, for being
considered a public nuisance at the minimum. They could be falsely
accused of drug use, intoxication, and public nudity if someone who
complains is more intolerant, or if the person who is employed as an
officer is in a bad mood, or isn’t of good character.</p>
<p>Two key ingredients to the homelessness problem appear to be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ease of making someone a nuisance for invented reasons,</li>
<li>Knowing and getting to spatial coordinates that have low sleep risk
index ratings
<ul>
<li>(such an index does not exist, but could be created. That it does
not exist is a problem too).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Areas in which complaints would be high would be as dangerous, or
more dangerous, due to police, as areas where theft or violence could
occur. Going to jail, or being accused of an additional crime is worse
than say, having something stolen that is of low importance.</p>

id="factors-in-basic-travel-and-homeless-life-provisioning."><a name="factors-in-basic-travel-and-homeless-life-provisioning"></a>Factors
in basic travel and homeless life provisioning.</a></h2>
<p>This post isn’t intended to be more than a development on the prior
posting, which indicates that ability to cover space to find sleep is an
important focal point for resolving problems of homelessness.</p>
<p>I assume there are a number of ways of categorizing key
ingredients/factors and that the concepts could be organized in a
variety of ways. Probably, however, there is a finite number of clear
and discrete measuresthat can be used to arrive at a nearly complete
description of the problem, and to arrive at a strategy that would be
workable under present conditions.</p>
<p>Here is an initial list of factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Comfort
<ul>
<li>It is not clear to me how fundamental this is. It may be possible to
overcome discomforts through repetition. I often change plans simply
because I’m uncomfortable. When I’m uncomfortable due to lack of sleep,
I can be extremely inclined towards some more conventional alternative,
like a hotel room, even if there is high expense. Additionally, those
who appear to have overcome the discomforts, if they are really
identifiable to me, are the one’s who seem dirty and worn down. They
appear to be in hardship. I wonder if maybe becoming comfortable in such
a life implies certain losses, which are not well known to people.
Consider if you had to camp forever. To what extent would you become
like a homeless person in appearance and behavior?</li>
<li>I keep coming back to comfort on different aspects of this style of
living. When traveling, camping and such, backpacking, one cannot carry
much food. This implies discomforts of finding food and using energy for
that purpose, which for me implies down time for recovery, and of
physical discomfort with climate, and of, again, poor sleep.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Sleep Quality
<ul>
<li>Sleep quality includes more than might be obvious at first. Having a
good sleep implies that your shelter needs are met (even if you sleep in
the open), that you feel secure, that you feel safe, and so on. This may
mean training is needed to become aligned in one’s mind with actual
risks. In other words, someone might simply be too worried where risks
do not exist. If you are not worried at all, and there are risks, then
you might be similar to a homeless person who has become accustomed to
being harmed. Your possessions can be stolen when you sleep, and you can
be victimized. Quality of sleep implies locale considerations. You can’t
visit the worst part of town, and sleep on concrete without serious
risks, but some do it. You can visit certain parks, more proximal to
nicer locations, and do it, but many don’t because they become worried
of risks that might not exist.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Homeless and Camper Quality of Life Index?
<ul>
<li>Thinking about this further as I write down factors that are
certainly not reduced to measures, I realized that an index of quality
of life could be created for measuring different spaces, to provide a
means for determining which places might really be suitable for some
number of homeless people or campers.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Coordinates of centers, and boundaries, of reasonably highly scoring
locations on the above index.
<ul>
<li>This makes the index seem more plausible, because what we are doing
as campers when we think through where we can go already includes
thinking about what is satisfactory and unsatisfactory, and it is
already unerstood that there is a gradient. This is akin to a
user-generated ranking system, like Yelp, where visitors can say if a
location was worth visiting or not, and measure on a scale up to five
stars (which is really a scale from 0-10 because halves are allowed).
But there is currently no system which allows for ranking any location
for how welcoming it is to sleepers, the homeless, or campers. It is
more for designated areas. Areas which already have some specific
purpose assigned.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Degree of welcomingness of an area.
<ul>
<li>Seems to include the designation part, because an area is not
welcoming, or is even hostile to, sleepers, homeless and campers, if it
has another recorded purpose. Land is zoned for different uses,
particularly when somewhat populous. Even in locations outside of
townships, however, huge tracts of land may be owned by private owners.
Privately owned land is already zoned though, so even if not privately
owned, usage is questionable.It appears now on reflection though that
ownership is the primary factor, because without being owned, it cannot
be zoned. Thinking further, in writing, there is a pair of items of
interest. Who owns the land (including nation), and what is the
designated use of a tract within certain boundaries.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Sleep risks for coordinates.
<ul>
<li>At what coordinates can you sleep? What is the welcomingness of such
a location for sleep and risks for each coordinate? Even if you book a
hotel visit, these concerns arise to the toursists mind. Any traveler
has to think: “Is this hotel one that has risks?”, and if one does not
think it, one’s plans already have it covered. I.e. “I will stay at this
fine hotel in this nice part of town, because I know it will be on
coordinates that have few sleep risks.” Even if you don’t travel, and
you stay at home, you have to have considered where your bedroom would
be. Are you comfortable sleeping at home or not? Not everyone is. And
that would relate to sleep risks at those coordinates where the bedroom
is located.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Laws about stationary behavior versus movement.
<ul>
<li>In some places people are encouraged to move along. They occupy a
range of spaces along lines, but occupy each space only for a brief
period. How slow can one move in locations such as public trails, and
section-line easements? Can you take time to rest and recuperate.
Section line easements are quite long? Public trails may be very short.
Length of the trail and proximity to owners of other property seem to be
factors. What power do owners of nearby properties have on things they
visually dislike?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Risks of being called a visual nuissance.
<ul>
<li>This fits into what was already written but it seems we would
benefit from additional attention to elaboration of concerns. Why did I
add this? Well, aside from property ownership of specific parcels, and
of public use, and so on, is people’s opinions about what they see, even
when they are not on their own property. This seems to matter, because
even in locations where someone is allowed to sleep, or camp, or be
homeless, there would be certain limitations that would relate to the
potential arising of claims about the existence of a public nuissance.
Someone looks bad, someone smells bad, someone is doing things I don’t
like, etc… Even if you own property, you could be attacked by someone,
including law enforcement, on the basis of some claims about nuissance.
These claims can be false claims. Visual nuissance is important because
it can happen over a great distance. Audible nuisance could be included.
Either way, you might be on a location where you are allowed to be, and
someone or some group can purge you, simply by claiming that you are a
nuissance.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Risk of false claims.
<ul>
<li>Risk of false claims is of special interest, because people really
will lie in order to get what they want. Suppose you are a homeless
person, and you have chosen a location using a mobile application, which
says there are few people in the area, and it has a high safety rating,
or the sleep quality index rating is high. Even if you were to visit
that location, there would be implied rules of appearance, decorum, and
smells/sounds. Which false claims can result in a criminal complaint, or
a civil complaint, that would be enforced by police.</li>
</ul></li>

<p><em>Preface: Interested in the issue of not having a place to sleep
suddenly?</em></p>
<p><em>Sunday, August 7<sup>th</sup>, 2022</em>, <time>2:29 PM Alaska
Time</time></p>
<h2
id="finding-places-to-sleep-as-a-hobo-or-traveler."><a name="finding-places-to-sleep-as-a-hobo-or-traveler">Finding
places to sleep as a hobo or traveler.</a></h2>
<p>After spending many years traveling, with and without plans, and
under varying circumstances, I’ve found that a fundamental problems is
just finding a place to sleep, and the distance between where you are,
and a reasonable place to go, to get that sleep.</p>
<p>Consider a normal scenario in which you are working in standard
conditions. You are employed in a job working normal hours, roughly on a
9-5 schedule. You commute to and from work with a vehicle, and that
commute is about 10 miles. Your home is where you ordinarily sleep with
comfort enough to get the rejuvenation you require to be and appear to
be rested. Anytime you are at work, or near work, then, if you feel an
urge to get rest, or feel sick, or excessively fatigued, you
automatically default to thinking about how to get home.</p>
<p>If you have been living this way for a very long time, considering
other places to sleep would seem unnecessary. You simply go home to
sleep, even if there is a long drive, and since there is never any
problem, the downsides are not really apparent to you. If tired, you go
home and sleep. Done.</p>
<p>When traveling without plans, issues become more apparent. Imagine
you jump on a flight to Phoenix suddenly. You just bring your small bag,
with clothes and only a few possessions. You have a small amount of
money and a couple credit cards. When you land you do not have a hotel
arranged yet, and after a delayed flight, you arrive late. You look to
book a hotel but find prices are too high for what is available, and
everything else is booked. What do you do?</p>
<p>In that circumstance usually I’m about to rent a car. So I would rent
a car, go to the rental station at the airport and pick it up, then
leave. Having no place to go for a hotel is not an unusual condition for
me. I would sometimes book in transit, or stop somewhere and decide
where to stay. Howver in this circumstance it is late at night and there
is no hotel to go to, and no friend to stay with. I could sleep
somewhere outside, or else I could sleep in the car. Sleeping outside is
not an option, even if I were carrying a tent, coming from the airport.
That’s because to sleep outside, one has to be a good distance from an
urban location, in a place where sleeping outside is not totally
unacceptable. Campling locations are always outside the city. As a
business traveller, I wouldn’t seriously think about sleeping outside. I
would just sleep in the car.</p>
<p>Sleeping in the car is very uncomfortable for some people, but not
everyone. Car models are rarely comfortable to sleep in, and there isn’t
going to be great control with vehicle type at a rental location. If you
rented a van, or something large, with a design permitting a large and
flat surface to sleep on, it is going to be a very expensive rental most
likely. In my case, I avoid rentals that are overly priced, and tend to
prefer full-sized vehicles, that are larger cars that are nearly as
inexpensive as economy cars. Still these vehicles are uncomfortable for
me. I have owned few vehicles that have been very comfortable to sleep
in. It is very clear when I’m in this situation that I’m not going to be
very rested, and I’m not going to be very comfortable, but I am going to
try to sleep in the car.</p>
<p>Now the issue becomes: “Well where do you park when you sleep?” Some
might be willing to park nearly everywhere, but then that gets police
interested. It’s very odd to have a police officer wake you up sleeping,
when you are very well off in life, and the cop assumes otherwise. That
is a situation I prefer to avoid. One wants also to feel safe, a place
that is more quiet, and a place where it is allowed, or tolerated, or
permitted. This means, however, one will leave an urban area, and again
have to drive outwards towards where people normally reside who commute.
So you become a sort of homeless commuter living in a car.</p>
<p>There are many choices for where to sleep in this situation, but no
matter what it requires decision making. It isn’t super clear where to
go, and even if it wasn’t a travel scenario, one cannot go to the same
place too many times. Because frequency will create interest, and will
convert a situation where it is allowed and permitted, and tolerated, to
one in which it is not, and in that situation, police can quickly get
involved. Either to check it out, or to remove the vehicle, or
other.</p>
<p>My preference is to choose a place to park that is at a 24 hour
business with plenty of quiet parking. For that purpose, I have a gym
membership that works across the country but is not guaranteed to be
available everywhere. In Phoenix, I could find a gym in a nicer part of
town, that is 24 hours, and park in a portion of the parking lot that is
uncomfortable. That requires a commute to that location. Once there, I
sleep uncomfortably, with some lingering unpleasantness relating to
concerns of social expectations. Even if it is allowed it feels like it
never is.</p>
<p>This is a really odd situation to be in if one really thinks about
it. Even if you’re very well off you may need to do all this to get some
sleep. But why would that be? Everyone needs to sleep. There must be a
market for people who need to sleep, I would think. But there isn’t! It
appears that this is an artificial situation, however. Various legal
constraints and costs seem to be the reason why this has not been well
developed.</p>
<p>Another strange question, beside “Why are guests not cared for in
this kind of scenario?” is “Why can’t I just sleep right over there!
(pointing to the floor, or a grassy locaiton outside in a public spot.”
Well, if you do that you feel unsafe, and you also feel that you will
get judged by others, and that the police may pay you a visit. Very
serious matter for simply trying to sleep on a public surface!</p>
<p>But it is even stranger with a car. You’re driving around and there
are many surfaces. Many totally acceptable places to lay down and sleep.
In Phoenix it is warm enough to need very little to feel comfortable.
You can sleep nearly anywhere. Driving nearly the same commute you would
normally drive, to a business that is 24-hours with parking, just to
sleep in a car feels oddly strange. There is a “Why is there so much
effort in this?” feeling. After many years I still have this feeling,
even employing various other strategies to find places to sleep. I think
it really relates to the observation that there seems to be so much
space, but no place is sufficient for laying down? No business has been
created to cater to the needs of anyone who just happens to be very
tired?</p>
<p>Now imagine you want to live on less. You are not a business
traveller like the example above. You don’t want a car, and you don’t
want a house. You would be fine with a really small apartment, or a
really small dwelling (an RV or tiny house), and it needs to be very
inexpensive. In this situation you will still need to sleep, and
sometimes you will want to suddenly get rest.</p>
<p>A fundamental thing that will always arise is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“What is the distance to my comfortable sleep location that is
socially acceptable, and how do I get there?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Assuming such a dwelling exists, and often it does not, depending on
region, it will again, not be near where you work or spend some of your
time. You will need groceries and so on. Again, it will likely not be in
the urban area where walking is possible, where more expensive
apartments exist. Suppose even the cheaper appartments in those
locations are too much, and that you don’t want those anyways. It’s your
life, and you should be able to choose your life, right? So instead you
opt for a micro-partment, or a tiny houe, or an RV more towards the
edges of the city, or in suburbs.</p>
<p>Now you can take a bus, or a taxi, or app-related taxi, or walk, or
ride a bicycle. Each of these have very serious drawbacks.</p>
<p>After exploring options, I find that the bus is too slow. It creates
unreasonable wait times, and it is somewhat odd to coordinate choice of
home location and bus stops. You will be walking even if you ride the
bus.</p>
<p>Taxis and App-related Drivers are too expensive to do routinely. They
might work when there is a sudden need, but the costs of using these
regularly will quickly grow to more than a car rental, which is just too
much for normal commutes for most people.</p>
<p>Now we have the bicycle and walking. I have thought much about this
in a sort of fog, as to which is better, and why I dislike one or the
other. Last year, I wrote something that I think clarified it. Which is
more reliable for each amount of distance moved was what that prior
writing was about. Now as I think it through, while typing, I think it
is:</p>
<p>“What is the reliability of bicycles versus walking for
effort/energy, and the relationship to the distance needs and
speed.”</p>
<p>If one lives very close to home, I think walking is the easiest. You
have no possession needs, no need to maintain anything, and it is always
reliable, and fast. At a greater distance, walking can begin to feel
infeasible. It requires too much energy, recuperation from walks, time,
and it becomes unreliable. Because if you are spending too much time
recovering, you won’t even want to walk, and will resort to something
more costly.</p>
<p>Cycling can make pretty vast distances easier. But they can be
dangerous, they create worries of theft, one spends time
locking/unlocking them, and they definitely will require maintenance.
They do get stolen. One might go through several bikes and have them all
stolen. You can get stranded. They can behave in irritating ways.
Cycling at long distances gets less reliable too for recovery needs, and
one can be sweaty getting around.</p>
<p>Between the two I think walking is an easy win. Walking is faster
than one thinks, requires no maintenance other than bodily maintenance
(and the cycle does require bodily maintenance too), is very enjoyable
for viewing surroundings, feels safer than cycling, is really
consistent, and requires no possessions. One doesn’t have to lock
anything up.</p>
<p>I think this decision may be up to the reader ultimately based on
lifestyle choices. Let’s say the choice depends somewhat on where
someone really lives and sleeps, and where one needs to go for work, or
other definitely routine needs.</p>
<p>Here we are closer to the problem. If you ride a cycle, probably you
live 3-8 miles from work, in your tiny home, or small apartment. If you
walk, you probably live 2-5 miles from work. Again, becasue there is the
constraint that the housing you want would not exist in the city center.
If you live 2 miles from work in a small apartment that is really
inexpensive, that seems a rare find. But that is possible. Let’s assume
you’re further away, about 4 miles way. And since biking and cycling now
are somewhat about the same issue now, of distance and time, let’s just
forget cycling and focuson walking.</p>
<p>So now you’re at work, you need to go home to sleep. You’re
exhausted. You have a 4 mile walk, which is almost certainly over one
hour. That still seems oddly unreasonable for a basic life function,and
it would become tiresome. But after your search to find a small tiny
dwelling to live in (which is rare), and your workplace is near to it
(which is rare), you can do the same thing daily in some comfort, and
still manage to get sleep when suddenly in need. Maybe with an
occasional expenditure of paying for a cab. But there is this odd thing
however, again:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“With all this space, why do I need to walk 4 miles to lay down?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But now let’s go further, and relate it to the travel situation. You
did not find a home that was cheap enough, or nobody wants you to live
at their home. You don’t have a place to sleep at the moment. You don’t
even have a car. You can walk though, but sometimes you are exhausted.
Now where do you go to sleep?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Notice: if you <em>did</em> find a place to sleep, wouldn’t it be
outside the city?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So now even if you found a place to sleep, you would be like a
camper, or traveller with tent, who wants to find a place to sleep in a
place where it is: allowable, tolerated, or permitted. But frequency
becomes a problem, just like for me when I’m in a car. I can’t go to the
same place everytime. Now you have to think and decide over and over
“Where am I going to go” knowing also that it is someplace far, and that
you will be walking.</p>
<p>Now you are in the situation of a homeless person who is perpetually
unrested, at risk of social judgement, at risk of being of police
interest. Some might think: “Why not just earn more?” But then one is
not noticing that getting a job is not easy for everyone, and not
everyone wants to choose that standard lifestyle of commuting. I
somewhat fall into that category, even though I’m finished with my
careeer mostly and have attained definite success and savings. I would
prefer to have an easy and safe place to sleep that is nearby to places
I need to go, but that market does not exist.</p>
<p>Always it seems, there is this odd lingering feeling: “There is all
this space but I cannot simply use the floor or ground, <em>anywhere
near</em>!”</p>
<p>Some readers might not think this a real problem, but even they
really do have to deal with it. When really tired at an airport waiting,
or at a hospital, or other location where there are only benches, in
parks or wherever, there is this same odd issue of not having a place to
simply rest on the ground, or on a surface. In airports, benches
needlessly have arm rests, that are not for resting arms. They are for
blocking sleep. Similar sleep blockes exist on benches in locations I’ve
seen, like at Atlantic City parks where homelessness is really
discouraged.</p>
<p>In places that seem more comfortable, where long visits are allowed,
there may not be such obstacles. Like at 24 hour gyms with lounges, or
casinos. But in these locations, duration of stay is roughly similar to
frequency of use. You might be able to avoid irritation in employees or
patrons, by napping for moments, but for any extended period of time,
people will want to control your eyelids. If your eyes are closed, it
must mean you are not a customer, or that you’ve been there too long.
Not knowing if either is true, they will assume it is true. Eventually
you will not be welcome, and you will either not be permitted, not be
tolerated, or allowed, and you may be trespassed with police, or face
false accusations and charges, from anyone who really wants you removed,
who might face resistance, from anyone who might disagree on your behalf
who you don’t know about. Suppose you sleep at the gym, for example.
After a couple days, you are unwanted by someone. That person then
begins to inquire internally at the company what to do. Some at the
company might not care. But wanting to get what one wants, that person
now begins to escalate the situation, even though you are not involved.
Suddenly you are a possible problem, for risks that may or may not
exist. Risks that certainly don’t exist for you, however.</p>
<p>At this point I would like to say I have a solution for this problem.
But oddly I do <em>not</em>! After many years travelling, and many
hundred thousand miles of driving, and over a million miles of flight, I
have no idea what one can do reliably under these common
circumstances.</p>
<p>It appears, in a very wide variety of ways, the social world has
decided discomfort is the solution for a class of problems, related to
homelessness, and unwanted people who might resemble the homeless, even
if they don’t really have much in common. Everyone who would like a
place to sleep, in conditions in which transit to home is not an option,
faces discomfort. But instead of solving it, it is ignored as a periodic
nuissance, and not a severe problem. It is even a <em>solution</em> to a
problem of keeping people away from places, who might need to sleep,
indicating possible homelessess.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“But what does that mean of our intentions to solve
homelessness?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are a class of related problems obviously, indicated in this
brief article. The solution of discomfort would have to be dissected,
and reasons for not having a market catering to the rest needs of
everyone would need to be thoroughly considered. I will likely go deeper
on that topic in a future article, but in the meantime, I would say, if
someone else solves this issue, and creates a business, or a more
permissive environment with different social rules, that still keeps
risks low, I would be very pleased with their accomplishment. It would
create a solution for myself, a person who is already successful, very
many travellers, and homeless people too.</p>
<p>I am now activley considering other options, as I explore this issue
on foot. In Anchorage, Alaska, I have a home that is about 8 miles from
the city. I have chosen to walk and not cycle, and periodcially use
app-taxis. I have ruled out sleeping at a business as an option, even a
comfortable 24-hour gym I belong to, with a rate of 138 per month. I
ruled out hotels, at least for this season, because they are each nearly
300 per night. Plus I lived in hotels a long time, and doing something
different is of interest. App related room rentals are also not in
consideration for costliness. So I will either go the full distance home
to sleep, or find alternative sleep methods.</p>
<p>For example, in this article it was not considered that one can sleep
during the day at parks. There are parks where this is not totally
unreasonable. But these are also somewhat distant from the city, so
walking to these parks would be necessary, and in directions different
from my own residence. Also, there is the option of not only sleeping
once, but sleeping several times a day instead. Some are interested in
alternative sleep schedules of chunks for 2 or more periods of sleep a
day, upwards of 8 or even more. It is possible, but maybe not
comfortable, to sleep very briefly in different locations, with emphasis
on sleep during the day. Then, however, one has the flexibility to live
at night, with acces to 24 hour establishments. I happen to have such
access, to my gym, and am semi-retired, so can basically sleep anytime I
like. This enables me to have chances at life-experimentation that
others might not have, and I will use it to see if this is really a
possible option. If it is, it may be possible to teach others to have a
similar lifestyle.</p>

id="harnessing-lack-of-death-fear-in-children"><a name="harnessing-lack-of-death-fear-in-children">Harnessing
Lack of Death-fear in Children</a></h2>
<p><em>to Preserve Confidence Over the Lifespan.</em></p>
<p>Thinking back to when I was a child I don’t recall ever feeling
especially fearful about the prospect of dying, while I did exhibit
those same fears, and remember dreams about, trying to avoid things that
seemed dangerous or scary, with the result of successfully evading the
danger. Of course that expectation of evasion was an irrational one.
These fears were about things like tornados and dangerous people, and
not about actual death. I recall when I was a tutor, one of my pupils
was scared about tornados in the same way I was. I wonder how common
certain dreams about evading such terrors might be.</p>
<p>While I was scared of things such as this, and spent quite a lot of
time thinking about them, I still do not recall really being very scared
of death. Later, certain ideas would pop into mind that would provoke a
fear of what I would imagine death would be like (a darkness of sorts),
but later I overcame that by realizing and really habituating the
realization that nothing can be imagined that is death, and that even
imagining darkness is incorrect. Really, any such imagined death feeling
is just something imagined, and the moment that is remembered, once
snaps out of any bad feeling about it. One might not transition out of
the imagination immediately, but recall that eventually everyone does
return to a regular state in which they are not thinking about death at
all. It is desirable though, to quickly recognize that one is imagining
something that really is not death at all.</p>
<p>I already wrote about this topic however, and included other postings
that relate to this, which can be explored below, if anyone is
interested. What I intend to talk about next is imagining oneself
behaving as someone else might be imagined to behave at death. I’ll
clarify momentarily.</p>

<h3 id="how-would-others-react-to-death-and-how-does-it-affect-you">How
would others react to death, and how does it affect you?</h3>
<p>This is about something I just experienced in the car but have
experienced a number of times. I went into a daydream, and during that
daydream, thought I imagined myself, or another who I was in the place
of, shaking the head violently trying to avoid helplessness in a death
moment. There was some image in my mind which I cannot recall with any
vividness, but I did recognize the source. I put myself in the place of
a copy of a memory of my ex-wife shaking her head when she felt in pain
and helpless. She had some behavior, which struck me as odd, of shaking
her head and having a sort of dissociated expression anytime she felt
she was in a kind of helpless pain. Not only when she was in very
serious pain but even with what appeared to be normal uncomfortable
pains (in other words, she did not appear to be in any serious danger
and it would quickly subside). I come from the field of psychology, and
from my studies assumed, but did not research further, that it related
to her reaction to events in childhood when someone put her in a
position of feeling like she was not in control. I feel I’ve seen or
experienced something similar, when wrestling and losing for example
with friends as s kid. Suddenly there is a violent perception of losing,
and wanting to purge unwanted thoughts and achieve some kind of other
control, which is unrelated to actual control of what is occurring. It
is also something that happens I think to victims of rape, or others who
perhaps were pinned too often.</p>
<p>Anyway, so what I imagined in a moment of a kind of fearful event
just before a death (still not death itself), was not even me. It was a
recollection of my wife’s behavior, but I vicariously placed myself into
the image which was outside myself and felt empathetically what it would
feel like, such that I confused for a second the image for myself. Like
I said above, I recognize what is not the actual event but a false
thought about the event, so I quickly snapped out of the daydream, but I
did feel discomfort for a short second or two.</p>
<p>Right after this, or just before it, I don’t recall, I thought to
myself:</p>
<p>“Kids don’t really seem like the are afraid of death.”</p>
<p>I thought about how some kids can’t comprehend it, because their
brains are developing and there is some abstraction required to
understand that people’s lives end, and without any experience of the
end of a life, it does not appear anyone is going to disappear. Through
certain conversations with adults and exposure, however, children do
come to realize that they will die. I’m not certain, as I reflect now,
that any human really comes to understand clearly what is implied, but
all eventually do outwardly recognize that life ends and people
deteriorate and decompose, and that it is inescapable, and that all
organisms have a life cycle. But it does appear people still struggle to
conceptually arrive at a comfortable understanding, and I do think
religion is a culprit of causing it to be hard to deal with.</p>
<p>In any case, what I’m observing here though is that I don’t really
remember feeling scared about death as a kid, but instead being injured
or being exposed to scary things. I don’t think I witnessed any real
fear about death in any family member or other person, but instead have
inferred that maybe they feel some discomfort in private moments. I
don’t remember anyone ever showing a facial expression related to death
fear. At most when the topic came up, people would become quiet.</p>
<p>Now consider that if kids are not fearful of death, and don’t
understand it, and are fearful instead of injury and scary things, then
if one removes the fear of injury via teachings about inevitabilities
and inability to control (which works), and also teaches that horrors
are kinda funny and ridiculous (also works), then what remains is a lack
of fear and lack of understanding of what death consists of. One would
also want to create an understanding of what death consists of in
reality, but here that doesn’t appear especially important. Think about
it, if you were not originally fearful of death and didn’t understand
what it was, then as long as you weren’t seriously injured, or didn’t
encounter anything too scary, then you wouldn’t have cared if you lived
or died.</p>
<p>An idea for the moment which builds on prior ideas which might have
some validity, but depends on an understanding of how children really
feel about death across all populations (variety has to be accounted
for), then a viable approach to feeling better about life and death
might involve preserving a natural lack of fear of death, and readiness
to admit that certain final moments are inaccessible to understanding on
the experiential level.</p>
<p>That might not feel satisfying to a reader who wants to know more
about what the experience will consist of but recall this post is just
about what might do a large percentage of the work to feel just fine
about it. There are other postings I’ve included that would help about
actually understanding death better, including the following ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>That one’s mind is not thinking about what the brain may never have
access to already. Admit to yourself that the rest of your mind that
you’re not now using could have been completely destroyed in a stroke
and in a sense that part would already be dead. In that way, not
accessing your brain is like it doesn’t exist.</li>
<li>An implication of this is as one’s brain becomes activated in
various ways throughout the day it is kindof like those other areas that
are not accessed do not exist. You are comfortable with that.</li>
<li>Every night when you go to sleep, if you are really tired, you don’t
care about life any longer. You would eventually become so tired that
sleep is desirable over any additional life. I think it likely that if
you were tired enough, and you were told that you would never wake
again, you would still be totally confident and comfortable just going
to bed!</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional ideas and considerations related to the above are in the
links provided. It may be worthy of research to see how children really
do grapple with the idea of death and what their fears really consist of
all over the world, at different young ages: because if they’re not
scared then they’re already done with most of the work, and instead we
are adding problems when there weren’t any. If this is the case then we
can perhaps recognize this in ourselves and make any adjustments we need
to make, already being exposed to fears of others.</p>
<p>Now I just remembered how this relates to what I was saying about my
ex and my experience. I was thinking of death in this way because I
witnessed her behavior and somehow substituted her helpless reactions as
my own. This means that one can easily come to have fears simply by
observing the fears in others, which should not exist. A challenge with
this example though is that her reaction didn’t appear totally connected
with death but with helplessness, but I imagined an addition that that
might be how she would react if she would be injured. This experience I
had putting myself in that position was not precisely a thought about
death, but about how one might feel being hurt before death, but it is
the kind of development that might influence how one feels about death,
and can be confused for death, and would still be an example of how
fears could be developed by seeing and observing the fears that others
have that might not exist with other teachings.</p>

of Placement in Gifted Schools</a></h2>
<p><em>This was a comment on a posting I just added, on social media
concerning the topic of special schools for the gifted.</em></p>
<p>I was tutor to one girl who was placed in gifted classes in school,
but it was not clear to me at any time if she were placed in that
context because of intelligence or because of high quality performance,
and she did not go to a special school, but remained in the same school,
which happened to be in a high income location. She was a very good
student, smart and curious. Over time though it started to seem as
though it were a challenge for her to remain in gifted courses. I was
from the same state, where IQ tests are definitely performed; however,
it appears in this school district in Howard county, there was
recognition of very good performance probably and not only IQ for giving
people vertical advancement opportunities. I’m not certain that is the
best course of action although I do like the concept, because testing of
course can result in some failures to identify. But, there was an odd
feeling that she could lose her place. I had no such feeling in my life
that I could lose place because it was already established with standard
test. I would have liked more the idea that performance would also
indicate permanence of value, but still, I’m not even sure she was
comfortable trying to maintain her placement. Since I was only a tutor
(7 years though), I was not comfortable asking her parents about her
intelligence scores and actually it didn’t even occur to me to ask,
likely because of how inappropriate that would be. Anyway, I’m somewhat
of the opinion that testing should establish a permanence of placement.
I would have liked being placed in a special school but was not. I was
given opportunity permanently, but did not do it permanently because of
the nature of the guidance I was getting from my parents at the
time.</p>

id="positive-health-event-and-planned-time-away-from-social-media"><a name="positive-health-event-and-planned-time-away-from-social-media">Positive
Health Event and Planned Time Away from Social Media</a></h2>
<p>Hello all, letting you know I will be off of Facebook and social
media for a while, and potentially for a long while. If you have
anything of importance to tell me about feel free to send me messages
via FB or using my cell number if you already have it.</p>
<p>Yesterday I experienced an interesting health event, which is a
reason for wanting to be off social media a while. It was not a negative
health event; rather, it was a very positive one. Apparently I’ve had a
kind of condition since I was hit as a kid around 3rd grade. I was
punched in the stomach randomly completely on surprise, and could not
breath as a result. In order to cope with that mentally, and attempt to
find ways to self-protect going forward, I became more vigilant and
started to self armor. I would tighten my stomach and otherwise try to
feel fortified thinking I could control future occurrences of
aggression.</p>
<p>I continued the practice of tightening my abdominals through my
childhood and later as I started bodybuilding in highschool.</p>
<p>During this time there were no serious side effects so I had no
obvious reason to stop doing this, and looking good from bodybuilding
and feeling strong and tight in my midsection, and having a good
appearance, I kept doing it, until a couple years ago, after a stress
event being chronically harassed for political reasons in Anchorage,
Alaska, and elsewhere, as desire to harass spread.</p>
<p>Initially there was no dramatic improvement to my breathing as a
result of stopping my self-tightening and armoring, which can be likened
simply to keeping a tight stomach to feel trim and strong. I simply let
my gut out a bit to try to feel more comfortable breathing. However,
breathing improvements did not really occur and actually worsened for a
period.</p>
<p>This issue was not COVID related and began as a result of chronic
group harassment in public locations that I would refuse to stop
visiting. It improved during COVID when I had it, because of forced
quarantine rest, in which I experienced relieved breathing problems. I
would continue to put myself at risk for the purpose of retaining a
normal active life, even though recently single, which was a
contributing stressor too.</p>
<p>The side effect of this armoring appears to have affected my voice
growing up even through voice change as a teenager. Additionally, later,
it seems to have affected how I accumulate mucus in my lungs as a result
of stress. It also affected my ability to sense my diaphragm and control
the enlargement of my lower left lung cavity. I would feel sometimes as
though my lower lung was not functioning periodically, in the last two
years.</p>
<p>Yesterday, however, after a very long period of trying to force my
lungs to open, and my diaphragm (or other internal unknown control
organs) to function, I finally had a less than small incremental
success– a large success, finally controlling this area of my lungs, but
also, in deepening my voice to a lower pitch which felt oddly more
natural.</p>
<p>Next time you see me, or hear from me, on video or in person, or on
the phone, you will probably be surprised I don’t even have the same
voice. It’s much deeper and much more calm.</p>
<p>I wasn’t anticipating that such a transition was even possible or
desirable. I was experimenting with a lower voice to see how it would
feel recently. With this event I’ve confirmed my breathing system, and
voice, and abdominal controls are working together better as a system
and suddenly I feel much better, even though, I’m the type to always be
cheerful in any case. In other words, this did not create happiness for
me that did not already exist, but created a sudden comfort.</p>
<p>I’m highly motivated to focus on myself for the time being and return
again to social media and make contact with friends again after a
prolonged time away.</p>
<p>But I also wanted to make sure that everyone knows I’m not trying to
ignore anyone in particular, or that I’m not wanting to have
communication, but instead I want everyone to know that I’ve had this
positive happening, and that I want to talk again in the future, after
really habituating the changes completely.</p>

ordering, paying, and tipping at restaraurants, that I recommended to a
friend, who also subsequently used it, because it’s much simpler, and
creates self-control in ordering behavior.</p>
<p>This method is very simple. At the outset of the meal choose what you
want in total at the start. Order everything at one time, and pay in the
same interaction.</p>
<p>This does a few useful things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Minimizes awkwardness with service staff.</li>
<li>Makes your behavior more rational, particularly when you notice
negative ordering trends.
<ul>
<li>I vaguely recall using this method at the Cheesecake factory to
ensure I didn’t order appetizers (or to ensure the order was smaller). I
realized I knew the entree alone, or a simpler meal would be adequate,
and that I would need no deserts. The result is:</li>
</ul></li>
<li>It provides a plan for ensuring meal costs are lower,</li>
<li>that you eat the right portions without risking overeating, or</li>
<li>creating waste through takehome containers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Just today I realized:</p>
<ul>
<li>It creates peace and quiet if that’s desired, and</li>
<li>Keeps tip costs down, and removes the gaming on the side of the
servers, for gaining more tips with you,</li>
<li>Making the deal more honest,</li>
<li>Without losing all the service that is really wanted which is the
goal of the restaurant visit.</li>
</ul>
<p>Today was my first time using this method in over 10 years, but on
reflection this is a much better practice, and I intend to repeat it
until it is the only way I order.</p>
<p>If there are any limitations to this approach I will reveal them;
however, since I’ve done it before, and I’m reflecting on it afresh
finding additional reasons, that seem to have no harmful side effects to
the experience or relationships, I think it will likely be permanent.
However if not I will share otherwise later.</p>
<p>Probably this method can be used in other buying scenarios but I’m
not sure what those scenarios might be. I have the intuition that this
would be the case but no examples come to mind at the moment. I don’t
think it’s the best method for all buying scenarios, and can think of
counterexamples. I.e. when the up front costs are not fixed or are
unknown.</p>
<p>Correction to the above. There is the risk of having a poorly
prepared meal. I realize now however, that one only has to ask for the
check up front. One does not have to pay. Depending on what is ordered,
if there is risk, one can simply arrange everything for payment, and
consider along the way what is a reasonable payment. However, for this
present purchase, a beer at a Boston Pizza here in Cranbook, British
Columbia, Canada, I could pay in advance for the beer with lower overall
risk of poor preparation, and paying in advance, minimizing service,
minimal tip is necessary. I paid a 15% percent but doing things this way
may create opportunities to tip less. Consider that if you order, all
food is brought by someone else, and you receive drinks at once, and no
further interactions are needed. It’s like ordering from a register. In
that case a 10% tip may be completely reasonable and still quite good
for the effort provided by staff (they can focus on everything else
while you are still there, already satisfied).</p>

<p>I took a college course in Positive Psychology. A summary view
after:</p>
<p>It is a small discipline for being very young. It also relies,
because it hasn’t had time to construct its own concepts, on borrowings
from Asian philosophy. It is nice to read but there are clear signs it
would fail operationalization tests on the Asian philosophy (But also,
that entails, I think, much Asian philosophy fails). It’s objective is a
worthwhile and maybe a necessary one of jumping off the path
dependencies created by early medicine, of correcting things and not
focusing on strengthening things. Internal medicine versus other
techniques, etc… were focuses of our medical system, and there are other
approaches that have not been adequately developed. The strengthening
approach in Psychology does to me offer some really amazing changes in
perspective that would benefit most, but it will take some time to
develop and take hold, if it ever does. In a way the entire field sounds
a like a book title, that could get old and vanish from interest, rather
than a growing school of thought that will contribute towards the total
understanding as a named portion of the field, with name visible at the
main organization (I.e. contents page versus index).</p>

<p>Please add a comment if you are willing to constructively add to the
solution, offer an alternative solution or a modification to the problem
statement that might arise in another solution. Otherwise I prefer no
response because typically I am already knowledgeable or aware of
issues, limitations and additional information offered, even
historically when I have not volunteered that that is the case. I don’t
say that I already know what is shared typically, but I have discovered,
over the years, that I nearly always know what is offered already. But
what is often useful and different involves feedback of the sort
mentioned in the first sentence above. I invite that kind of intelligent
discourse for mutual growth. I can tell based on experience I don’t
really need anything but what is included in the first sentence. It
appears readers are unable to estimate my mentality going into my
writing. What is best involves creative contribution to problem
statements and solutions (including mods). Feasibility concerns already
well covered, even if they seem they are not. Solution abandonment is
already well covered even if it seem like that might not be part of
intent working on solving it. Purposes are manifold.</p>
<p>I use a related social snippet concerning mutual growth. I am only
interested in conversation around mutual growth. I’m not fond of
censorship, but wanting to use my time wisely, I will prune the
conversation as needed to create quality related to what I’ve started.

Supply as Scientific Supply for the Learning Population.</a></h2>
<p>Recently I’ve been enjoying myself visiting various hardware stores
across the country browsing stores in order to find materials that would
facilitate my scientific projects.</p>
<p>While browsing stores I have noticed that there are many markets that
have not been coordinated in such a way that their standards of
componentization would work together. I mentioned this earlier, but
lately have noticed additional concerns apart from those that I already
mentioned, which did include one worth stating here, that in order to
realize certain project goals, one needs to shop unnecessarily in
different markets.</p>
<p>Science is interdisciplinary and in order to do scientific work using
materials from hardware stores, which are the only places where one can
browse easily for many different tools and materials, one finds that
different trades use standards that are not lined up.</p>
<p>Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gauges of copper cable do not match the standards of metric bolts,
and building materials, and do not match gauges of shells used in
guns.</li>
<li>Many tools use engines that simply utilize rotation and a simple
interface to control rpm, power, etc.. Yet these tools do not share the
engines.</li>
<li>Tools use different types of connections which appear proprietary or
industry specific, with the result that a tool appropriate for one use,
which could fill another function cannot, because the method of
connection does not allow interoperability.</li>
<li>Joining metals, and metallurgy, demolitions, and soldering have not
been combined.</li>
</ul>
<p>One might think that there are no serious consequences to this, but I
think there are major consequences which have been overlooked.</p>
<p>One serious consequence is that people consume more unnecessarily,
including people who don’t have sufficient resources to do so, and also
that people have less learning opportunity for inability to join fields
effectively.</p>
<p>One has no control, for example, on what diameters of electrical wire
one will receive. They will be along the standard gauges. These wires
cannot be altered in their diameter. The result is that someone who
would like to join usage of these wires used in electrical fields will
not have simple ways to mix the standards with parts and materials in
other fields that use alternative intervals for diameters.</p>
<p>More interestingly:</p>
<p>Any innovation for joining the trades where the standards mismatch
would spend too much time for the reward of the innovation, which may be
only private, but even if it is desired that it is not only private, it
cannot alter the field, because again, one would not have adequate
influence to change the standards in the supply, and if one did, one
would not be rewarded by the industries change, particularly if the
project is just one among many, as it is in my case.</p>

<h2
id="responding-when-stopped-by-police"><a name="responding-when-stopped-by-police">Responding
When Stopped by Police</a></h2>
<p>Recently after being harassed in a Starbucks, I took a picture of the
person harassing me with my laptop. She had already pretended to take a
photo of me first. After seeing that I may have taken a picture of her
and her companion, she immediately demanded that I remove it from my
device, and started to create an altercation. I decided to leave, and
while leaving a Starbucks employee followed me out the door as if I had
done something wrong, and asked to explain what ocurred. Without at all
considering that nothing was wrong, and immediately assuming I somehow
did something wrong. I told him “talk to her” and simply left.</p>
<p>In the last few years I have been targeted with a good amount of
harassment and I think it likely that a similar ocurrence will happen
again. I also noticed there is a very strong trend for people to simply
harass people until provoking a response, in which they plan to lie
about to create a negative situation with police.</p>
<p>I also thought earlier it might be necessary to have a very solid
approach with law enforcement in case of getting pulled over too, and
for that reason, I planned to have a strategy that would mostly cover
all situations and ensure that I have a good position with law
enforcement even if someone has complained and lied in their
complaint.</p>
<p><em>Process</em></p>
<p>Rules of Thumb.</p>
<ul>
<li>Be willing to park a further distance from a business than
necessary, so as to ensure that there is no immediate connection between
your vehicle and yourself.</li>
<li>Do not carry your identification everywhwere.</li>
<li>Be willing to wear a hat or change your clothing quickly if you have
clothing available and deny that you were invovled to anyone except law
enforcement. Perhaps even law enforcement if you have reason to believe
they would not have footage that would make it possible for them to
definitely identify you. This might require some quick thinking. For
such an event it would not go any further to the point of your being
called for identification.
<ul>
<li><em>Rationale:</em> If someone harasses you, then calls the police
to make a false complaint, you can leave immediately without anyone
being able to say who you were, or connect you to a vehicle that would
be used to identify and locate you (notice: they should not be able to
locate you because you are the victim of harassment and are at risk of
being targeted with fabrications. There is no reason to think that
someone cannot simply call the police to attack you. If someone calls
the police, there is no obligation for you to remain or even acknowledge
that a complaint was made. This would imply that simply creating a
complaint obliges anyone complained about to acknowledge the complaint
and work against it, rather than totally reject it and put in no further
effort. Already a person complained against falsely has been put under
some stress, beyond any stress created by what transpired before the
complaint).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Be willing to call and file another police report, and if addressed
or approached by police, claim they are responding to your complaint. Do
not acknowledge the other complaint. Only acknowledge your complaint.
They are only there to help you with your complaint, and they have
to.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Have Camera and Recorder available. 2 if Possible.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Before approached by police, start both cameras. Do not acknowledge
that you have more than one camera. Mention that you are recording.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Have Generic Written Response, on Legal Letterhead.</em></p>
<p>Thank the officer for their service BEFORE handing over the legal
letter.</p>
<ul>
<li>Say to police if approached, stopped, etc…: “Please read this from
my attorney before we talk”.</li>
<li>Hand written response that includes:
<ul>
<li>What the response is for and ensure it is generic “This is for my
client Mr./Mr. <blank> in case of any conversations with police…”</li>
<li>Who you are.</li>
<li>Some positive life details.</li>
<li>Support of law enforcement and the legal system generally.</li>
<li>Details about how you always behave. (Prescriptively like
organizations do. “My client only strives to drive defensively and
carefully, and conducts himself/herself within the law at all business
establishments.”</li>
<li>Indicate that your time is valuable, and that any situation must be
dealt with swiftly.</li>
<li>Indicate that your lawyer may need to be present, and that will take
a while.</li>
<li>Indicate that according to legal professional conduct, you will be
defended vigorously and will take action against the police force if
necessary, although you support in other conditions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Comply with any requests for identification or other information.
<ul>
<li>Make sure your vehicle registration is available and have a
copy.</li>
<li>Make sure your insurance is available and you have a copy (even if
there is no accident, because they may cite you for driving without
insurance or not having your proof of insurance available).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Ask what the specific reasons are for your being addressed.</p>
<p>Deny any wrongdoing, or that there has been any severity to any
ocurrence. Everything is great, and you are doing very well.</p>
<p>Indicate you cannot speak much because your lawyer should be present,
but comply with simple questions.</p>
<p>Be assertive, but polite, about the need to end the police visit.</p>
<p>If the officer informs you of specific information, be polite and
accept.</p>
<p>Thank the officer again briefly on closing interaction.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>This is not a complete approach and certainly needs editing, and
inclusion in a better developed method, but in the meantime this can be
used to keep fresh in mind what a good approach is for remaining safe of
harassers and police who are misinformed.</p>

id="more-detailed-than-nature."><a name="more-detailed-than-nature">More
detailed than nature.</a></h2>
<p><em>[Only a few major punctuation changes. Unedited for a research
purpose that will be revealed later]</em></p>
<p>Sometimes it is astonishing to see the level of detail that exists in
nature on close inspection. Just a few moments ago, I was presented on
my Facebook feed with a hummingbird’s eye, and the area around the eye,
in very close focus. The detail in the feathers at first confused me
into thinking it might have been a chicken, but I was incorrect. That
same level of featuring occurs at a smaller scale in the hummingbird,
and it isn’t noticeable with normal eyesight since they are very tiny,
and their feathers have details that need some magnification for us to
see.</p>
<p>Some things living in nature which we are well acquainted with have
detail that is omitted from our views of them, using our own biological
sensors, and visual capabilities in our brains; but the detail exists,
and our devices for viewing those details are increasing, which allows
us, for a short time, to see those details indirectly. I.e. we can “see”
the detailed features only by relying on something to provide us a view
which has better detail, for us to view in the same limited way with our
regular senses.</p>
<p>Certainly there is a maximum ability of our eyes which we are all
well acquainted with, suddenly being unable to see things on various
conditions. We cannot see with great detail, and so certain things
appear blurry, or seem just out of view. This implies our resolution has
limitations viewing things afar and up close. Of course this is known,
but the implication is that our technology must be eventually better at
capturing the details even in our normal personal recording and
capturing devices. When will the camera have a better capture of more
pixels than my retina? When will its focus be better. When will the full
range of devices that are sensing be better than my own senses?</p>
<p>On the consumer market it appears that my senses have not yet been
beaten, but based on current position it seems safe to conclude that the
non-consumer markets doing research and development must have much
better. Probably these technologies are far from as good as humans in
finding things to look at and look at them effectively, by exploring the
world robotically, but for specific sensing acts of different things in
my environment, I feel certain that we are at a point where human
abilities are surpassed.</p>
<p>An interesting question though would be: “When will the cameras”want”
better pictures it could take that cannot exist?”</p>
<p>Yet there is also the limitations on nature for cameras, which is
interesting. Nature cannot present to my eyes things that can be seen
that differ from what it cannot present. Similarly, I’m accustomed to
faulting my eyes on not being able necessarily to see very fine objects,
but even on the human average, we are all not very good at seeing really
fine details; however, we have not faulted nature for being unable to
present us given the apparatus we have, via nature, for seeing fine
details. I could as easily fault all of nature for being poorly adapted
to my eyes, and not the other way around (although I wouldn’t normally
morally blame inanimacy).</p>
<p>Having cameras and apparatus that can exceed in providing detail than
what nature provides and what nature has equipped animals, and what
itself can provide in content, creates questions about why more does not
exist that is interesting, and why it would be possible to be able to
know more than nature can provide, and perhaps create more than nature
could provide.</p>
<p>Suppose you have a camera taking a video of a small animal not
normally carefully observed. Suppose it watches an ant colony very very
closely. Assume it can view at maximum fidelity, using a range of sensor
types, such that more detail cannot be seen, and that anything further
might be down to particles. It seems that it would follow then, that
using software, the virtualization could overtake the actual object in
interest, if the software adds fidelity that does not exist.</p>
<p>When would it be possible, for virtualizations to become more complex
and more detailed, and not less, than small natural things? Perhaps the
virtualization does not simulate the lowest-level, non-observable
subatomic-particles, but maybe it adds more elsewhere. If it could not
add more elsewhere, it would lead perhaps to a view of the
appropriateness of scale for certain objects, with there being no need
for the infinitesimal.</p>

and Earthworm-eating as Early Market-forcing Regulations.</a></h2>
<p><em>Initial regulations forcing market consumption</em></p>
<p>[Note: The writing below is in the context of my considerations about
how to live a more primitve lifestyle, off grid in remote Canada and
Alaska. Also, very few edits have been done, in keeping with my research
which I’ve mentioned but will write more about in the near future.]*</p>
<p>Today as I was thinking about plans to find a way to live primitively
with few human-artifacts, other than those I create myself, I wondered
about foods that would better enable self-sufficiency. A question I’ve
been wanting to answer for myself is:</p>
<p>“How can I minimally sustain my diet living in a remote location with
fewer resources and fewer activities expending thought and energy?”</p>
<p>I’m a strict vegetarian so already there is greater complexity than
for someone who is ready to hunt large game. Howver, somewhat recently I
realized even as a vegan I can scavenge for food, and eat already-dead
large animals and fish, since as long as they are cooked to a high
enough temperature they are still edible, even if decaying. It is not
unusual to eat decaying meat. Currently there is a trend on social media
to eat different dry-aged meat products, which are plainly discolored
and rotten by the time they are processed for eating.</p>
<p>As a backup, I did consider, after 20 years of not eat any meat, that
to enjoy my adventures, I could eat Salmon, if they are heading back
upstream to die ultimately anyway. I could spare them, perhaps from a
slower death, or from having their skins ripped off by grizzley bears
and bald eagles. Animals nearing demise seem more appropriate for vegan
eating, if that were necessary for survival or to avoid excess
discomfort. Already pet-owning vegetarians euthanize their animals at
death, and while they do not eat them, they could. But instead they are
prepared to waste the animal completely, like they do with human
corpses, rather than eat them, and regain some taste and interest in
meat potentially. My excuse for not wanting even a single taste of eggs,
even from free chickens, has been to not fall back into an interest in
eggs. Friends have asked questions before about which animals would be
suitable for eating given my commitments, and I’ve answered mostly none,
because of this view that to try it out could alter taste and create a
craving that could lead to a return to eating meat, or, as I think of it
now, a discomfort in having to remember perpetually what the meat tasted
like, or the eggs tasted like, after being free of the taste for a long
time.</p>
<p>Let’s transition back to the present topic. Above I explained backups
that can be used while trying to live primitively as a vegan-vegetarian.
I realized today, as I was driving through Texas, that insectivory and
earthworm eating might be another good option. While it isn’t my
preference to harm anything that might suffer, it does seem also quite
in the norm for vegans or vegetarians to want to exterminate pestilence.
The lower the life-form, the more open I think vegans and vegetarians
would be to eat other options periodically. Our earlier ancestors were
composed of herbivores, and frugivores, who were undoubetdly, and
confusingly, partly carnivorous for their eating of insects, or were
more definitely insectiovorous. It is also possible easily scavenged
small animals were eaten, but at a lower frequency, for bing more
difficult to catch, and for being uncommonly easy. More definitely, our
ancestors were herbivorous, frugiverous, and insectivorous, somewhat
like other large primates living today in Eastern Africa. While eating
vegetation, insects would be present, and based on how primates eat, it
appears humans also would have been largely unconcerned about insects
residing in, or appearing on, different fruits or vegetables, and if
they lived nearby, and were found delicious, they also would have been
targets of eating habits. Similarly, probably honey was desirable, and
larvae may have been present nearby, in, or around honey.</p>
<p>As a young kid I would collect tulip poplar flowers and eat the
nectar found at the base of the flower near the stamens, at the bottom
of the petals. Not knowing if these flowers really had edible nectar or
not, I ate it anyway, and naturally found the taste quite good, somewhat
similar to honeysuckle nectar, and ate it whenever the opportunity
arose. Oftentimes there were already insects trapped in the nectar, or
other unwanted debris, and unknown materials. I was mostly disgusted by
this, and did not eat that, but I think living in nature, I would have
been more concerned about eating enough than to eat foods that have a
high level of purity.</p>
<p>Already we eat foods that are known to have insect parts and eggs
within them, and if we leave some products on the shelves at home, they
will eventually have worms and things living in them. As a kid I recall
opening old boxes to find foods to eat, when we were mostly out, and
found insects in them. Certain foods are well known to have these things
growing in them if left a while, perhaps with some damp conditions. I
remember oatmeal would be one food that would fairly predictably have
worms in them if they were left too long.</p>
<p>Another possible cause, however, is insects finding their way into
some of these foods and laying eggs which later hatch. Sometimes the
source is already in the food (fruit flys for example, which means we
routinely eat fruit fly eggs if we eat bananas often, unless they are
only within the rinds), and sometimes the source would be external to
insects which lay eggs which later hatch. Either way, we are eating
insect parts, and insect eggs, even if we are vegans and vegetarians.
This does not mean that vegans or vegetarians are not vegans or
vegetarians, however, since upon inspection, it is clear that the supply
chain necessarily includes animal contributions whatever choice about
diet is made, even if one were to obtain all food products separately by
growing at home or by gathering. The commitment is related to primary
food target selection and depending on the vegan/vegetarian, fulfillment
of certain health benefits and probably also, to reduce cruelty to
animals we already naturally have some concern about. This is not a
complete statement on this topic, but rather serves to give some
information relating to the present topic about potentially choosing
more deliberately insects and possibly earthworms, if one wants to try
to live more primitively, in environmens like the environment I’m most
interested in, but have not yet stated, which is northern territories in
Canada and Alaska. Elsewhere it might not be necessary to consider these
options.</p>
<p>In northern territories, it is possible to get along quite easily on
fish, already dead animals, and insects, at least during the summer
time. In the winter, some conservation would need to be relied on, for
what was previously gathered. Initially, I will be trying to live off
grid, in remote territory, as a hiker/gatherer, during the summer time
after thaw and before any snow begins. In this time, depending on
location, insects can be very plentiful.</p>
<p>How does this relate to early regulations on behavior and possible
disincentives to life self-sufficiently.</p>
<p>Going from memory, I recollect that strict Kosher Jews prohibit the
eating of certain potential foodstuffs, including very specifically
insects.</p>
<p>From my understanding, it is not known why this prohibition would
exist, although some would claim that the prohibition of eating pork
products would relate to possible health risks that were unknown at the
time. Those risks would then justify completely abstaining for lack of
any other better strategy for treating the foods for eating. Insectivory
may have some risks around disease that are unknown, and I do not know
anyone who I would ask to find out if any ailments would result from
eating insects, so complete is the prohibition in our civilization. We
do not know and do not have common knowledge for not having sufficient
interest to eat the foods and for conducting science to discover what
risks exist. There isn’t enough interest to try. However, given our
knowledge of bacteria and viruses and what it takes to kill them or
prevent illnesses more generally in foodstuffs, we can predict that we
can cook a huge range of insects and effectively kill any risks
contained. Drying the foods may also provide a mechanism of protection.
Either way, now we do have knowledge about more specific risk factors,
and have the means to discover risk factors scientifically, making
earlier prohibitions irriational today, if reasons cannot be given. It
appears however, this information is not based on wisdom, but is based
on a transitory need to avoid issues where the true risks were not well
understood.</p>
<p>Relatedly, but as an aside, it must also be acknowledged that fear of
rodents and other insects also have little rationale behind them. For
example, it must be admitted that rats do not pose a known risk, and may
not be as risky to have around, as people claim. The same appears to be
true with roaches and other “vermin” which may not really be vermin at
all, as much as an irritation to keep away, for purification of one’s
living environment, to keep it more consistent in appearance and in
overall comfort.</p>
<p>What were the true motives of making a prohibition against eating
insects, and in some places, prohibitions against eating earthworms
(which I hear is a prohibition in Asia, although some will continue to
engage in the practice)?</p>
<p>There is the want of maintaining certain appearances to seem more
civilized to outsiders who might judge adversely, and perhaps use as a
pretext on annexation or attack.</p>
<p>“They are mere primitives and we can take them.”</p>
<p>There is also the possiblity, which could even be a germ of current
regulations, which is the desire to prohibit certain actions to force
market consumption. This could exist wherever there is a desire by a
ruling or elite class to force people into dependency and into having to
spend money or exchange resources, in a disadvantageous way, to obtain
goods which are not available except from sources in the interests of
the elite. Knowning that this is a continuing issue, and concern about
regulations, in a variety of types of concerns, it is likely that this
motive existed even then, and that a desire to prevent earthworm eating,
and insectivory, and self-sustaining lifestyles that might seem less
than civilized, would come from elites who would benefit from having
more customers, and they could achive the switch by creating social
pressures. As I think about this, I find it likely that the above
interest in creating an appearance of greater civilization would be due
to manipulation more than by a desire for self-protection.</p>
<p>An issue with living in the north for vegans and vegetarians who do
not want to be dependent is having sources of non-animal proteins and
fats, and frankly, enough variety in plant crops. As an Alaskan
resident, I am quite dependent on the grocery store and on foods shipped
from all around the world. Even if I were to rely more on local produce,
I’d be limited to cold weather crops, some other crops during the peak
of summer but not in great plenty, and berries. This is not satisfactory
for the entire year. In any case, there is still the need of oils from
elsewhere, and proteins from legumes and other sources that are not in
the state.</p>
<p>When I imagine myself living in very remote locations, in itially as
I learn, I imagine starting with food I bring with me. This would
include store-bought products that are vegan/vegetarian. However, I want
to gradually find a way to be self-sufficient on ingredients that exist
naturally in the areas, which means I will need to scaveng on already
dead materials, find already dead or dying fish, or eat something I
wouldn’t otherwise eat. Those foods are insects and potentially
earthworms (depending on region), or grubs and other things that live in
the soil.</p>
<p>While I prefer to not eat these things, by finding seeds and other
vegetable foods in the environment, I am considering considering not
entirely vegetarian food sources, like insects and earthworms, which are
more simple animals, which migh be killed easily and swiftly, and might
provide all the nutrients of protein, fat, and other micronutrients I
would need to survive.</p>
<p>It’s not clear if such a choice would lead to increased culinary
abilities, or less, or that I would ever be able to serve the foods to
anyone else than myself, in a condition of definite need, if I’m wanting
to live or maintain comfort.</p>

<p><em>No edits</em></p>
<p>Thinking back, I know I’ve heard that “life is hard” many times. Life
is so difficult, people think they need to pursue ancient solutions, and
think their missteps are not just theirs, but are common. “Everyone is
living a difficult life” is a religious message, and people seem to have
adopted it even today.</p>
<p>What I have not heard, maybe not even once, is that “Life is easy”.
Recently I considered that life is extremely easy, but somehow people
have not recognized it.</p>
<p>People, true, may believe their lives are difficult and may have also
made it hard on themselves and others. I want to avoid a confusion so
I’ll offer another clarification. Making life relly simple is not hard.
A solution for making life easy should not begin with a persuasion that
it’s hard. Instead what I want to do is pursuade that it’s easy and show
that it’s easy.</p>
<p>“Life is hard, look, I’ll show you how hard it is” is a message of
the religious. If you can make it easy, then why not begin by persuading
that it is easy, and by showing how and why you can ensure it remains
easy. Can’t you adopt your own solution easily?</p>
<p>It’s so easy you don’t need to look back on ancients and involve
yourself in lengthy spiritual journeys. You can just write it down how
easy it is, for yourself first, and then maybe share it for others so
they can feel like they are current, and not ancient.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>But really even looking at others and their difficulties, I think to
myself, life is easy despite you. It is easy despite what you say, what
you think you should do. It is easy despite how you think you “solved
it”. You face the paradox you created by claiming you solved it and that
you didn’t. “Life is still hard” you say. I say this even while thinking
there are differences in lives and therefore some lives are more
difficult than others, but the lives that are difficult are not common.
Maybe you got in a car accident and your eyes point the wrong way, and
you were born with a birth defect that makes you mostly immobile and
unable to eat. That’s not you. Ok?</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Most problems are created by those who complain, and in relatively
few ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creation of health problems,</li>
<li>Entering into relationships, or keeping relationships, that are not
valuable,</li>
<li>Becoming addicted to drugs,</li>
<li>Having a sex life, that is not autoerotic,</li>
<li>And entertaining non-reality based thoughts and goals,</li>
<li>Living or frequenting an unsafe location.</li>
<li>Miscellaneous hazard creation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Victimization certainly exists and can occur even without creating
relationships. However, much still involves those items listed
above.</p>
<p>Yet you learn from others that living in simplicity is what results
in a “good life”. “Simplicity” does not mean you do not live well.
Rather it means you live well, but you simplified, according to risk
avoidance.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Imagine you decide in advance you have no kids (you don’t know who
they will be anyway, that was a fantasy). Imagine, you have few sexual
relationships. Instead, you choose to enjoy yourself (and you enjoy
yourself more), and make use of being around people who are attractive,
and using entertainment that is safe (you don’t want pornographers to be
at risk either, or you can use other entertainment), and thereby avoid
unwanted children and STDs (you did nothing for STDS, and Trojan did not
solve it for you, or solve it). Now, imagine you are armed with a
solution that makes life easy, and doesn’t claim it’s hard and that it
will stay hard, and that you’ll need an afterlife, but somehow it is
still “solved”. You are smarter than believing that religions have
solved your life for you.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Your parents created you as a result of a combination of sexual
disire side effects, and social customs which lead them to
unreflectively imitate the lives of others. “Should I have a family?” is
not really a question taken seriously.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>This is not a conclusive article on this topic, and I can think of
other ways that people can make their own lives challenging. However, I
am not convinced that life is hard. Life is easy. It is usually easy.
When it is not easy, it is still easy usually.</p>
<p>When I was reflecting on when I was sick, or when I was hurt, I
realized, those were easy times. I was not working, I was sleeping and
eating, and simply resting, not doing much. But social expectation leads
me to think of telling people things are not going well and so on. But
things were going well, in that I did not work, I did not concern myself
about many other aspects of my life and I spent my time doing only a few
things and had rest from many other things I might otherwise be
concerned about.</p>
<p>Making a realistic ratio of experience to time living is helpful to
convey that life is easy and not hard, because you’ll find that
hardships were only a small fraction life life experiences.</p>
<p>For example, I had some terrible digestive pains, and other pains.
But if I express this in a histogram, on a frequency distribution, what
I find is that it is only a few moments in my total life.</p>
<p>If I complained, it would likely be to get attention, or to get some
positive benefit from other people.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Lstly, death is easy. Death is not hard. Pain is not enjoyable. But
death is not pain. Everyone dies, and if you die early, then that is not
really hardship. If I were to get seriously sick or injured, death is
not really an additional hardship. Instead, it is a solution for
hardship. Life is easy most of the time, and there are few moments of
pain, and if there is severe pain, then death may resolve that,
confirming that pain can be infrequent. However, some elect to remain in
pain. This is not something that is hard to resolve?</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>A few drugs are useful in life for pain managemnt, and using those or
planning to use those seems desirable. One wants to avoid addiction. But
even if addiction causes trouble, it can still end in death which is not
so painful. Everyone will deteriorate, and I’m mindful of the drug
addict who has permanently altered their health. Their lives are still
fine. We are judgmental and that causes their additional issues. Here I
will consider that if I were to become a drug addict, and died, it isn’t
so differnt, than say, becoming old, and dying. Becoming old is worse
perhaps. It can be drawn out, particularly if one has religious views
about prolonging pain, against ending life in a way that is
comfortable.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Now I recover myself from thinking too much about those who say their
lives are hard. I think they delude themselves. In foreign countries,
some are very happy, with much less. Religions state there is very
little needed to live well, and one would do better with less. I find my
life easy, even when society would lead me to think perhaps my life
should be considered hard. I shouldn’t consider others who think this
way as much, remaining “positive” (sarcastically), according to their
views.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Would anyone adopt a life strategy that indicates it is really
easy?</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>I was thinking, perhaps such a strategy could be conveyed to 4 year
old children in a span of 6 months or less, in what would amount to a
single period in school, for those in later grades.</p>
<p>Consider:</p>
<p>The objective of school is supposed to be to make life easy.</p>
<p>But for some reason, adults are going on “spiritual journeys” to be
“saved” and are cretaing kids who they will teach need the same
thing.</p>
<p>You need a spiritual journey but you were in elementary school, in
the “best” country or countries in the world?</p>
<p>Did your teacher go on a spiritual journey?</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>I depend on myself, and life is easy.</p>
<p>If I were to teach in school, the objective would be to make life
easy.</p>
<p>If you left school and your life was “hard”, I would want to be able
to conclude:</p>
<p>“You did it to you.”</p>
<p>If you taught well then that would be what you would want to hear,
otherwise, it is because you left them ignorant about something
important.</p>
<p>So it soundedharsh but was not. Instead, being taught in such a way
that life turns out not easy, and you feel ignorant, and you think you
need celestial assistance, is harsh.</p>
<p>“I left you ignorant after all that time, and searching for the wrong
things in the wrong places.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>When people are struggling, don’t you think somewhat, that they are
deluding themselves?</p>
<p>Ok you eat, you drink, you are somewhat active, and you repeat.</p>
<p>Sleeping all the time is fine.</p>
<p>How does life in misery result from good sleep?</p>
<p>Sleep might help, but again, the social world teaches otherwise.</p>
<p>“If you sleep, you are not doing what I think you should do.”</p>
<p>But when I was in Mexico recently, they seemed calm and restful.</p>
<p>What exactly are you saying they need?</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>You didn’t check other cultures for an easy way of life.</p>
<p>Ok, consider: If you eat food, drink water, and sleep, are you not
doing well?</p>
<p>So now you are supposed to be “Great”?</p>
<p>Ok, so let’s do a frequncy distribution of great accomplishments
(popular accomplishments), over all people.</p>
<p>How many people were popular at school?</p>
<p>How many are popular over the globe, in entertainment, business or
politics?</p>
<p>It’s a very small fraction.</p>
<p>Ok, now consider, sleeping is nice. Food and drink is nice. You may
accomplish, but you can’t hold onto it in any case.</p>
<p>Living as a kid, without being too much distrupte or controlled, is
easy and nice.</p>
<p>So what exactly made it hard?</p>
<p>What if it’s not hard?</p>
<p>I think it’s <em>very easy</em>, and maybe we will be presented with
some discontent that it’s “too easy”.</p>
<p>However, then it’s “too easy” and what complaint can you really
have?</p>
<p>Except perhaps that you did not want to live.</p>
<p>But you said “life is good”. So you do want to live. “Life is hard”
but you still think it’s good.</p>
<p>I think if your life became easy, incompatible views could easily be
taught to you still.</p>
<p>But instead, consider an easy enjoyable life is enjoyable.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>You are an “optimist” and are “positive” and so I shouldn’t believe
you when you say life is hard and you need an ancient “spiritual
journey” for salvation.</p>

<p>You might survive if you are sexually attracted to yourself.</p>

<p><em>[Written without any edits or spell checks, somewhat slowly, in
26 minutes. Writing without editing is part of a study I’m working on. I
will reveal the purpose of that study in the nearish future. This one
could have some issues, so skip ahead as needed. I hope it makes you
fear death less. If that is the result, then missed edits is just
fine.]</em></p>
<p>Here I want to spend some time continuing the topic of reducing fear
of death by sharing some points regarding your current state of mind and
your lack of feeling that the rest of your mind, your inactive mind,
could be dead already and you wouldn’t know it.</p>
<p><em>Thoughts that never load, or recur</em></p>
<p>Your brain is a repository of a very large amount of information, and
you know this already, when after many years, you suddenly prompt an old
memory, from a smell, or a sight, or a reminder from a friend. I
frequently recall experiences only when I have conversations with people
who somehow manage to bring the conversation to a point that relates to
something I normally would not think about, but perhaps thought about in
depth in the past.</p>
<p>So when these thoughts do not load, they are just in there, in some
brain structure that has been maintained over the years by your
physiology. Your cells get replaced, over many years, and your diet
shifts, and yet your brain is able to maintain certain pieces of
information, that await some elicitation. You are not aware if it’s
there or not, or what’s there at all. This is a point where there can be
no refutation: Everyone with a brain has information stored, memories,
that they don’t know exist, and they are unaware of what precisely
exists in storage and what does not. So they are unable to state
precisely, what is already dead in them and not.</p>
<p>This is soothing to me to know, because what this means is that I’m
already familiar with death, not only in falling asleep, and
experiencing anaesthesia, but every moment I’m awake too.</p>
<p>In addition to the points above relating to not knowing what all is
stored, is the point that if you never load it again, it is also like it
is dead already. Another universal experience above noted, is that we
are triggered suddenly to recall bits of info we did not retrieve in a
long time, and perhaps could never retrieve. I had a conversation about
this with a relative who believed that they stored their entire life in
memory, and I commented to them that that is not all that useful, if
nothing is around to prompt its retrieval ever again.</p>
<p>Which brings me to an interesting idea: even if you could store all
the information in your life, and let’s say more, all that resides in a
large library, it would not be all that interesting if you could never
retrieve it, and if you were utterly dependent on smells, and sights,
and conversation to bring it out. It would be dead in storage.</p>
<p>What can also be inferred from this is that your brain is not
constructed to know what information might be useful later, so much of
your information stored in your mind could be useful, but will never be
retreived again. Which means it can hardly be asserted that human beings
are all that well equipped in future management. Rather it does what it
can by allowing for a good amount of storage, compared with other
animals, but maybe not compared with future animals or computer systems,
and that it creates pottential opportunites for retrieval.</p>
<p>This is also soothing to me. Because again, it means that I am well
acquainted with death. If I never recall my life, and cannot recall it
without certain rare opportunities that depend on my environment, then
it’s like I’m just in a fraction of my mind anyway, and this fraction
shifts around a bit in my mind, but does not use all of it at any time.
So that section could really be dead, and I’m content with that part
being dead all of the time. I’m content with a small mind, and it
shifts, so I’m also content with shifting away from things perhaps
permanently.</p>
<p><em>Learning</em></p>
<p>As we learn, our minds shift from prior structuring to newer
structuring corresponding to the difference between our prior thoughts
and our newer thoughts. Learning is growth, and also implies different
structure in the brain an utilization of that structure in the future.
Consider that you would not suddenly have the thoughts you would have
had as a child on a topic you did not yet consider as thoughoughly as
you have more recently. When you think about that same topic, it’s as if
the other structure were dead, because you are never conscious of that
older structure. But, more importantly, connected with the prior point,
while you have this topic in your mind, you don’t have any of the other
topics that could be considered in your mind. You would not be aware if
all structure corresponding to these other topics were suddenly
destroyed, as long as they are sufficiently unrelate to the current
topic.</p>
<p>From this you can think “All that has been substituted or changed is
already dead.” Why would this help? You are already comfortable with the
fact that when you change topics, you are not thinking everything else
that you could think at the same time. It is comforting or me to know,
that I’m unconcerned as I think that everything else might not be
there.</p>
<p>I’m comfortable with the death transition from my earlier brain to my
later brain.</p>
<p><em>Conclusion</em></p>
<p>What I’m trying to do in sharing this is provide people with
additional ways to think about their own minds that will make death seem
less worrisome, if it is at all worrisome for people. Perhaps it will
become an area of worry as one ages, if we can believe what people say
about death experiences. Thoughts like these make death seem not fearful
at all.</p>

your sex, and Discover Your Lack of Moral Sophistication.</a></h2>
<p><em>[Written in 13 minutes with no edits, and no spelling or grammar
checks. The reason for this will be revealed later, after my study on
this topic is ready for sharing.]</em></p>
<p>Regular people who have not studied moral philosophy pretend to be
morally upgright, while the reality is that they cannot explain their
own moral system, and have a system that has no development. I’ve
commented on this before on a post about the “Heap of Advice” which is
basically a list in memory of phrases from religion and culture, that
cannot be reconciled or made to be consistent.</p>
<p>A simple device for revealing that people have very little moral
sophistication is to ask them to justify their sex lives and their
sexual behavior, and to reveal it to you. This will reveal that privacy
is connected with lack of reflection, and lack of ability to reflect. It
also reveals that there is no knowledge at hand for making sex related
decisions from religious texts or from the culture, if the culture has
provided only a “heap of advice” and is itself private. Because if it
supports privacy it is unable to inspect relevant information and grow,
and is stifled. Thus at an individual level, and collective level, there
is a lack of sophistication, and arguably, lack of consistent morality,
at least on sexuality. Do you think morality is consistent?</p>
<p>Now, suppose you did have a process on sexuality. It would include
when to have children. But the problem with that, for you, is that in
our culture, you were taught that it was meaningful to get salvation, or
otherwise select among religions, which are often called spiritual
journeys. Why did you need salvation and a spiritual journey if your
life was worthwhile, and how do you justify creating a child if this
observation is true of you. Did it enter into your decision making when
you thought about how you would decide when to have sex? You don’t even
know when to create life? Again, how do you justify your sex?</p>
<p>It is clear that sexual behavior drives much of the market, and the
information that we are exposed to very frequently, if not most of the
time, has some sexual aspects or components. What this means, is that
your lack of decision ability on any morality pervades most of your
life. Including your purchasing behavior, planned life behavior, etc…
since presumably, when to have sex, includes who you will have it with
and for how long.</p>
<p>STDs we are told are quite common. Yet I see no worry about AIDS or
other STDs at all, when I’m out at the bar. I’m unaware of any social
media behavior that includes within it a good approach to testing the
other person you’re having sex with for STDs. Nevermind you don’t test,
and you don’t test between instances of sex; the more important thing,
is that even if you were monogomous and married, your spouse isn’t
necessarily monogomous. So how do you know that your spouse doesn’t have
STDs? You believe cheating to be common, and an average reader did
cheat, and potentially said nothing about it. In that case, the reader
knows, their significant other could not test them appropriately, for
possible deadly STDs.</p>
<p>Did you know that our culture, and you, truly have a primitive idea
about morality. You just say you are moral, but that doesn’t mean much
for your sophistication, does it? If you were more sophisticated, you
would look at others like yourself now, and realize you are hardly moral
at all, and don’t understand what it means to be moral.</p>

Thoughts, Fear of Death, and Death Plans.</a></h2>
<p><em>Death thoughts could be somewhat random and unexpected shutdown
thoughts.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Aside: Back to the need for a real death plan, and the topic of
removing fear of death]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We should give up on believing we can control our last thoughts.</p>
<p>“What was my last thought before sleeping?”</p>
<p>That did not concern me.</p>
<p>Sometimes, dreams start fast, when I’m very tired, and my thoughts
when half awake, and half asleep</p>
<p>can be very strange.</p>
<p>I’m fine with that and it can be somewhat funny.</p>
<p>Final thoughts must be more subject to lack of control than thoughts
before dreaming.</p>
<p>They may make less sense, be less cohesive.</p>
<p>I can’t pretend they are the same, because that would be forcing them
to be the same, to provide comfort.</p>
<p>There are similarities only.</p>
<p>Truth is important, and truth provides <em>more</em> and not less
comfort.</p>
<p>Because the thought could arise later, after coming to believe this
is true</p>
<p>that your belief that it would be like entering a dream is preparing
you</p>
<p>for something that you suddenly notice must be different.</p>
<p>“Now I’m unprepared for this, and I’m fearful,” could be the
reaction.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Death involves deterioration of a vital organ, and with age may
include brain deterioration.</p>
<p>Either way, if it is organ deterioration or failure, or brain
deterioration and failure, the result</p>
<p>is loss of brain functioning.</p>
<p>We say rightly people are dead, in the way that matters, when their
brain has stopped functioning.</p>
<p>So at the time of death, you can expect your thoughts will change
over.</p>
<p>The change of thoughts depends specifically on what actually happens
to your brain.</p>
<p>Consistency cannot be expected.</p>
<p>Control certainly cannot be expected.</p>
<p>This means religious plans for thoughts before death,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>“last words”</p>
<p>are plans doomed to failure.</p>
<p>If one looks at the full variety of death,</p>
<p>one sees people are usually dying differently from each other</p>
<p>because their age, ailments, and final death event is unique.</p>
<p>This does not mean there are not commonalities.</p>
<p>But a doctor who has seen many deaths, must agree,</p>
<p>particularly if the communicate with army medics,</p>
<p>and people who have seen deaths outside of controlled
environments,</p>
<p>that it does not occur with controlled thoughts.</p>
<p>We have to give up the idea that we will be able to control our
thoughts at death.</p>
<p>Our thoughts may be nonsensical, opposed to our views</p>
<p>We could think gibberish.</p>
<p>We could think enjoyable thoughts, or painful thoughts.</p>
<p>The variety relates to the variety of conditions that a brain can
have, or be exposed to.</p>
<p>So at this moment I have difficulty expressing the full variety.</p>
<p>It is <em>that</em> variable.</p>
<p>It may be <em>more</em> variable than many other experiences in
life.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>This makes the plan for death EASIER however, and not harder.</p>
<p>You cannot plan your last thoughts.</p>
<p>The better strategy is to be comfortable with any thoughts you have,
as you are living</p>
<p>as you fall asleep.</p>
<p>Strange thoughts, illness thoughts.</p>
<p>This strategy is part of living anyway, because if you are
comfortable</p>
<p>with how your mind operates one way or another while living, you will
live better.</p>
<p>This may have some utility when transitions occur at death.</p>
<p>Other than this, one might be better off not trying to control
thoughts.</p>
<p>One cannot train for death thoughts.</p>
<p>Also, one can plan for how one will die, rather than handing that
over to a final medical visit.</p>
<p>What drugs might end you while you’re still clear?</p>
<p>I have stated before, that a plan to let a hospital control your
end,</p>
<p>after an unpredictable health event,</p>
<p>is not a controlled plan.</p>
<p>It is much better to admit, that any chosen death pathway is a chosen
death.</p>
<p>This means people who are willing to have suicide are</p>
<p>saved from shame before and after death, because they planned
differently</p>
<p>and want some control.</p>
<p>This is not all that can be said on this topic, of course.</p>
<p>But it reveals that one can have a larger plan that will make things
better very likely</p>
<p>at time of death, if it is not anomalous or really unpredictable.</p>
<p>But then additionally, in our plan, we have to account for what
cannot be planned.</p>
<p>In this brief post it was final thoughts.</p>
<p>I would recommend not giving final thoughts much value for planning
consideration,</p>
<p>except perhaps to include ways of death, while not completely
deteriorated,</p>
<p>that may involve drugs.</p>
<p>When you have surgery, and you get the drug to put you to sleep, it
is understood by all that it is not painful, and does not include
anything mentally that you do not greatly fear.</p>
<p>You count down until death, and if you wanted</p>
<p>you could substitute that countdown, for any planned thoughts.</p>
<p>Although I recommend not planning so much on that.</p>
<p>Giving up control is what makes it work well.</p>
<p>“I will count down and then sleep.”</p>
<p>Controlling too much may result in</p>
<p>“I didn’t do it right, let’s start over.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Perhaps for next time:</p>
<p>“How much do you let other people control your death thoughts?</p>
<p>To what extent is it related to</p>
<p>Your ancestors having been conquered.</p>
<p>I was controlled on death by conquerors of my ancestors.</p>

<p>I’m noticing a trend in which people who appear quite intelligent in
written expression, dodge failure to understand a thesis by engaging in
semantic fault-searching. They are unable to see the meaning of the
writing and somehow remain interested, apparently for the fun of doing
something that still requires smarts–finding what could be considered
inexact in the language. Some people seek out typos, misspellings, and
grammar issues, that amount to syntactical oversights, while others look
for “blemishes” related to meaning and semantics. They often miss
creative usages, or usages intended to elucidate, and instead consider
them mistakes.</p>
<p>Either way paragraph and document meaning and syntax are missed,
because they lost holism and missed the main goal and thesis.</p>

<p>How Universal is Gaslighting?</p>
<p>Gaslighting, in short, is altering history to make it favorable for
some objective. Most commonly one is accused of gaslighting, if one
starts to play with someone’s mind, to alter their ideas about what has
happened, even though they were exposed to what happened.</p>
<p>I’m not going to explain the unfortunate moronic gaslight metaphor
though. I hope we can change it at some point.</p>
<p>Well, I used to think only other people gaslight. I think I’m
incredibly not guilty of this compared to other people, since I’m
honest, and strive for truth. If I thought I committed this error, I
think I would correct it afterwards upon noticing.</p>
<p>However it is worse than this so I have to admit I am guilty and so
is everyone else. The reason is that it rationalization IS a
gaslight.</p>
<p>When being highly introspective, one recognizes sometimes, the order
of thoughts in relation to decisions is unclear. You may feel that your
rationale preceded your decision, or that you had it, when in reality it
was forming, and you didn’t have it, and you decided–then the rationale
formed, and you articulated it afterwards.</p>
<p>If you are unaware of this occurring in your mind, I promise you that
you simply haven’t noticed it yet.</p>
<p>This means that after you make a decision, you lead yourself to
believe, that the preceding rationale was had, but it was not. Other
reasons within you existed for the decision. So your afterthoughts
gaslight you. You are gaslighting yourself.</p>
<p>Ok this occurs so frequently, that you are certainly doing it to
others too. Many of these are forgivables, being lighter cases of
rationalization. Some who are less scrupulous, have less introspective
capacity, less experience in psychology, less practice with honesty, or
more practice in lying, etc… will do this often.</p>
<p>So it must be stated that it is universal that people alter history,
and at the time of recording history have already performed gaslighting
in their minds, and will commit those results to paper. Partly because
they don’t know they do it, and partly because there is a strong motive
to do it. If people do it naturally, in the process of rationalizing, do
we not think it goes further?</p>
<p>Particularly in autobiographical accounts.</p>
<p>There is a range in the propensity to make the error, and the size of
the errors, and therefore, being predisposed to do this does not make
one an example of the worst case. However, I think the average case is a
very bad one. Particularly if we enter into this a supposed need for
privacy.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Response to a commenter, connecting skepticism to the above.</p>
<p>It sounds like you are connecting this with a skepticism for absolute
worldviews. I did not make this connection as I was writing this, but
your thoughts, and the OP, do support some growth directions of
skeptical thinking more generally.</p>
<p>An issue that I think you probably noticed, and would appreciate my
comment on, is that there are a lot of other psychological things that
should lead to that same skepticism. For some reason though, religious
zealots and those who committed without enough thought, to an absolutist
perspective or school, are unpersuaded by these considerations.</p>
<p>I think this is due to inability to introspect effectively, and
process what is observed in introspection. Training in psychology or in
biases, and logical fallacies might help, since of course education
improves ones reflection on one’s own thinking. But I think also there
is just a brain limitation.</p>
<p>Religious tolerance could actually, in the near future, be about
tolerance of lack of brain development.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Response to a commenter, about the reality of rationality, despite
rationalization:</p>
<p>Both [Rationality &amp; Rationalization] have not been given a
phenomenological or physiological/psychological basis, or a really clear
description, and so we struggle. But yes, rationality <em>does</em>
exist. Some people truly are rational at times, and I count myself as a
person definitely in that group. If I were not in that group, I would
claim it doesn’t exist.</p>
<p>One can really sit down, plan, evaluate options, consider
probabilities, one’s inclinations, and choose, and even train oneself to
have habits consistent with planning. Is this a complete description of
rationality? No, but it is a pointer at what is a trend towards more
rational thinking, and not less rational thinking. I say this because it
indicates that there is something akin to rational thinking that is
real, and I don’t think one can seriously claim there is no such thing.
Also, notice people who are rationalizing, want to gaslight people into
thinking that they did plan in a way that maximized detachment. They are
pretending to be like people who really are objective.</p>
<p>There is this other thing about pretending to be rational. If you
speak clearly, and show clear thinking, and consideration, you <em>look
like</em> you are rational. People who are rationalizers are very good
at pretending to be like people who are admired, and I’d say are better
at pretending, than being, since rationality 1) comes natural to the
talented, and 2) is hard. But people can pretend to be that one guy who
was rational frequently right?</p>

<p><em>Some Thoughts on our Unplanned Master Project of Knowledge
Development, and Works like Berkeley’s</em></p>
<p>As I read the Introduction to Berkeley’s Principles of Human
Knowledge, and Three Dialogues, written by Roger Woolhouse, I realized
there are some strange motives for writing, that are part impersonal,
part not.</p>
<p>Also somewhat disconcerting and disillusioning about the history of
Philosophy.</p>
<p>Berkeley’s work seems to fill a gap in a context, in which
alternatives that were similar to his philosophy seemed already
explored, and pointers to his philosophy somewhat well discussed. At
least, participants in the philosophical correspondence, that involved
actual communication in person, in letters, or in works/books
themselves, and a small community of participants, seemed to have
exhausted systematic concentrated efforts on similar pathways.</p>
<p>A question that arose in me, reading Berkeley is, did he write this
because he became aware of a pathway that simply was not explored, and
that he, having a certain compatible disposition of belief and
commitment with this pathway, followed it because nothing prevented
him?</p>
<p>Did some of these philosophers simply develop down an available
direction that had some interest?</p>
<p>Write a book, because you can fill a gap your life is compatible
with?</p>
<p>Then I wonder to myself, am I seeing opportunities for writing, that
result in my related writing? Or do I have some other approach that I
follow?</p>
<p>My motives seem very different than Berkeley’s, from appearances.</p>
<p>His system seems to <em>apropos</em>, too timely, on a topic that
does not require development.</p>
<p>It is very clear that I am not interested in this sort of writing.
Certainly, I have novel ideas, and wish to explore those ideas. But, if
these ideas are not completely tenable, I will not pursue them.
Moreover, I do not follow pathways of writing that relate to gaps in
community contribution. It appears Berkeley filled a gap that is
predictable, one that someone else would have pursued further, if he had
not pursued it himself.</p>
<p>I considered perhaps he developed his writing here because he saw an
opportunity for receiving a readership. However, this could not be his
only motivation, since his worldview is compatible with the outcome of
his writing. It is possible, that he introduced his work, that explored
a nearly explored region of thinking, because he recognized an
opportunity congenial to his interests. Being congenial to his
interests, he had incentives to remain interested. However, the results
of his writings have two qualities:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The system he devised is absurd and cannot be seriously adopted,
and</li>
<li>He had opportunity for readership, filling a clear gap in the
literature.</li>
</ol>
<p>…</p>
<p>Do some write primarily because they see holes to be filled?</p>
<p>“My results are untenable but as a business move it’s effective?”</p>
<p>“I would be seen as authentic writing this, given my background, and
what I’m writing pursues a path that, well is one of only a few
available paths already followed, and I’ll get a readership, and will
earn money, and a place in a community of correspondence?”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>His work exists, which means someone has written about the topic, in
a way that completes the need.</p>
<p>But his work is being taken seriously, and certainly it is
untenable.</p>
<p>Which means he performed an odd service by filling the hole, but a
disservice in making his contribution seem, well worthy of reading.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>An interesting point: what works of science are being produced for
seeing a hole that exists, that need not be filled, and need never be
considered?</p>
<p>Perhaps this is the reason I’m feeling an uneasiness about this works
existence. It seems to point out a human tendency to want to have a book
in the library covering a topic, because the topic somehow arises as a
gap to be considered.</p>
<p>Creating volumes that distract.</p>
<p>Funding exists to create volumes that consider all that seems to be
open for consideration?</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Which topics are those we should simply pass in a cursory
fashion?</p>
<p>Which are those we should develop?</p>
<p>It does not appear that we develop knowledge in a way that values
what the outcome of such an inquiry would be, and instead, intellectual
freedom and other independent decisions take precedence.</p>
<p>I’m interested in developing this unfruitful pathway, out of various
self-interests.</p>
<p>One cannot align personal interest with the objective project of
knowledge growth unplanned.</p>
<p>What is this plan of knowledge growth?</p>
<p>It does not appear there is any overarching plan for developing human
knowledge as a master project.</p>
<p>So we end up with Berkeley’s Principles, and scientific research
papers that have no reading value.</p>
<p>We have this tree of knowledge, and it certainly grows like a tree,
growing however it grows.</p>
<p>[Aside: As I was writing and finishing this, I felt I was being
unfair to Berkeley. Yet this was my thought process arriving at the
important intuition, about the unplanned nature of our tree of
knowledge.]</p>

Social Snippet, No Analysis, Assumes Complete.
</h3>
<p>
On reading this comment it appears the reader has a view they believe to
be complete. However regarding this topic it appears the writer is a
layperson. An expert in this topic would be someone who is called a ““,
or someone who has researched to become approximately an”“, with the
added constraint that learnings relate directly to the problem. An
alternative, or in addition to this, one can gain the expertise
necessary given talents, other related experience, and research that is
suitable for a mind to bring the topic to completion. Just these do not
imply the mind has arrived at completion. One must show that analysis
and sophistication that would first indicate profundity is adequate.
This is a rarity; but even apart from the rarity, it is a stark contrast
it seems to what the reader is showing.
</p>
<p>
A quality analysis would show some understanding of math although
mathematization of topics are long and torturous; so there is some
recognition that mathematization would not be shared, but an awareness
of applicable principles might be adequate. Completeness would require
that it is finished. “Intuition backed on the mathematical method that
would apply but has not been rigorously applied” would be akin to
“Leadership Judgment” that is still better than leaderships who are
available usually apply.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, complete views finalizing topics would stand up to
reconsideration and time. However, these responses seem haphazard and
reactionary, and not cool and well considered.

Social Snippet, Confined Criticism
</h3>
<p>
This comment appears to fail to acknowledge that writing that is
performing a function of social criticism is attempting, quite often, to
reach a solution by first identifying a problem. That is the case here
as well with this posting, even if this is not obvious. The intention
may go unrecognized but this is a key intention. Critical postings
arouse various reactions in an audience. Some will find it a challenge
and will via cognitive dissonance attempt to reinforce their views. Some
will feel the same but instead of offering a reasonable response, or a
non response, will react with emotions to create damage as if the
emotions were founded on valid thinking. Some will simply want to
consider it “negative” and create distance or do the same, even without
knowing the meaning. This might be called “cognitive dissonance of the
type: mismatching emotional preference for topic.” This would be
cognitive dissonance where the reader has a conclusion they believe to
be “positive” and if it appears different, it is still a challenge even
if the content is ignored. These people will respond reinforcing their
view by attacking without even understanding, or with understanding but
the content out of view (preferring to attend to the cognitive
dissonance issue resulting from social attitude.
</p>
<p>
Additionally comments like those above generalize. A confined act of
criticism is about the topic and not about all topics. The dissonance
can elicit a range of errored responses, and I have no desire to
identify which applies, because the reader is already required to make
sense in responses. This requires an understanding about which emotions
are appropriate when, what rules of collaborative argumentation are when
there are disagreements, and what is logical or illogical. The last
requirement can have some forgiveness because our cultures failed to
teach logic. Logic is nothing special and uses regular language but is
not easy to independently discover. However, if too illogical I will
consider communication with the reader impossible (permanently depending
on the severity). It is easy for the experienced logical of natural
language to see the issues, but they cannot be communicated to those who
merely assume they make sense with no experience, who in fact can’t make
sense.

Significance of Mind, and the Plausibility of the Conception of “Will to
Power”, in Nietzsche.
</h3>
<p>
The plausibility of Nietzsche’s conception of the “will to power”
relates directly to our experience, over our entire lifetimes, of
delight at attainment of all our skills. The “willing” aspect of this
“will to power” relates to the willingness to struggle to overcome a
difficulty, which might be as simple as learning to walk, or learning to
ride a bicycle, but includes all those skills that are necessary to
become a normally functioning child. The “power” element relates to the
attainment of the new skill, subskills, and other transformations
feeling like they are learning experiences leading to attainment. The
striving element we are familiar with in the “will” is for making gains
that are felt to be necessary. There is a need or a want and we are
motivated to act, and this active and catalytic motivation is ‘willing’.
There is more power in completion of something that leads to more
general skill acquisition that can be seen to apply to a range of
things, than less; and when this is noticed, and attained, a more
significant transformation has occurred. Something akin to potential
energy in physics. One has a potential biological process that can be
used again and again, and you continue to have power in reserve through
that skill, which is rooted in our biology; the greater the
applicability and remaining life-energy the greater the reserve. It is
not exaggeration to say that learning proceeds with this power element
being almost always involved. It is involved in the detection of a need
or a lack, the sudden drive towards taking actions that will satisfy the
need and lack, the effort required and undergone to fill a lack, and the
accomplishment of the skill that covers a range of lack. It is likely
that this “will to power” can be further reduced to other more basic
principles of psychology, and we should completely reduce the phenomena
to this and related scienctific findings; but a recognition of the will
and power elements at play here are pervasive give credibility to
Nietzsche’s view and reason for looking into reducing it further.
Without such a recognition, the underlying causes of this phenomena may
be buried another hundred years.
</p>
<p>
A person who is able to extend the skill to cover more lacks, and fill
more needs, has attained a greater significance in their method of
action, than someone who only fills a lack that is less general in
application. There is a relationship here between significance in action
and skills, and significance in ideas, which is further reduced to
significance in mind. This connects to my view that those who are more
intelligent and more creative have a greater velocity of significance
production in ideas (Mattanaw, 2021), but in connection with Nietzsche’s
will to power there is also the component of significance in action, and
not only in ideas. A life that concerns itself for mental growth
includes both, and I seek to have this in high degree. Those who
recognized in my earlier article something of themselves in ideation
<a href="christopher-matthew-cavanaugh-thoughtstream.html?fbclid=IwAR2GhTeEVpiCxCTcTI3dOaPQdEFds0l3-t0ZsPS8lPTCl0jRgmfWD3VIuFM#the-significance-of-ideas-and-creativity">“The
Significance of Ideas and Creativity”</a>, will notice that it is
somewhat distinct from action, but not entirely distinct because range
of significance of action depends to some extent on range of
significance on ideas, except in those cases where a skill is attained
that is accidentally applicable in many cases elsewhere. However even
the actions that are significant enough attainments are applicable
elsewhere, one needs to have the vision and opportunity, to create
opportunities and detect times to apply the skills. This offers strong
argument against living without pursing significance of action in
addition to significance of ideation. Here my desire is to segue into
the importance of feedback loops in action to gain both opportunities
for creation of improved and more significant ideas and actions;
however, this is not the best moment to develop that point.
</p>

One takeaway would benefit the reader. Creating feedback loops on
actions can increase one’s minds’ value. Because a sedentary
intellectual that does not experience results of their own actions and
ideas will not have feedback to build upon (Relates to weaknesses in
Aristotle, not yet being an experimental scientist. Not without
justification). This is how intelligent people eventually, through
laziness, fall into the trap of having “untested ideas”, and they feel
the effects of having had few feedback loops, for having only a little
motivation. This relates to my interest in motivation, and my already
prepared material for improving motivation
(<a href="strategy-one-tips-and-tools-managing-procrastination.html">Strategies
for Managing Procrastination, Part One</a>). Since motivational issues
involve what prompts action, and prompting action is a lifelong
experience, beginning in youth, one article targets youths in
particular, with the intent that it extends beyond youths to everyone,
because everyone can relate to being or having been a kid. A prior work
which I may include soon was the very first article on my website
relating to procrastination. In this location I do not offer heuristics
like I do in the previous, and instead move forward to offer a pathway
at more permanent development. This work on procrastination requires
minor edits and will be added again soon. It is 5 years old now, and was
the very first work on the site, yet has not been edited to the
satisfaction of the author, which speaks to both procrastination (in the
editing), but not procrastination in the original urge to creation.

The notes below are the source material for the above writing on this
topic, and I include it along with the original marginalia, or notes in
the margins, of my copy of Walter Kaufmann’s fair treatment of
Nietzsche’s thinking. In this work concepts of Nietzsche that have been
misunderstood are clarified and placed in context, and as I was reading,
I noticed the will to power has a good foundation in animal experience
including humans, and has great significance.

Will to power as a primary motive force and sociological core/commmon
explanatory central principle is impalatable probably due to our bias
against power.
</p>
<p>
It may be more palatable and discerning of weak but popular aims, if it
may be connected with all purposeful action since purposeful action
includes the element of power to control actions and control outcomes.
If the power necessary to secure sedired objectives did not exist, all
objectives and controls along the path to objectives would fail. And if
failed, learning would be wanted, and this is want of power and this way
we made the same conception popular.
</p>
<p>
In the bias against power all have forgotten their own phrase that
“Knowledge is power.”
</p>
<p>
So it turns out that “knowledge is power” may not be as available to
awareness as bias against power. Oddly education is knowledge for power,
and so the bias indicates minds are greatly contradictory, since when
“knowledge is power” is remembered, education is forgotten? In
education, bias against power is largely forgotten. In this line of
reasoning Nietzche’s high consistency can be seen, and it would explain
a split in approval in his audience, between those who react to their
first thoughts involving bias in power, and those who react to first
thoughts about power in knowledge and learning.
</p>
<p>
Everything you do is dependence on your own skill and learning which
satisfy power requirements for doing anything, including walking and
chewing and drinking and swallowing. Even in nature the early learnings
are empowerments, a word we enjoy probably because we feel an increase
of power in it, whereas if the fear power and feel less powerful that
bias wins out.

<p>
“It is not entirely easy to determine who is trolling and who is not
because we have not found a clear definition of the term and have not
seen clear examples for identification. Here are a few examples of
trolling that lead me to believe that this is what you are doing:
Sharing a meme or video that is irrelevant but has the effect of
provocation, or goal of leading others to censure and discount a message
without additional thought, with hopes of gaining a following of
commenters taking interest in the comment over the actual posting. Goal
is to create a subthread that dominates and shadows the main thread.
Comments that are verbal and short that simply stab at the author on
grammar, on spelling errors, on typos, and other issues where the
meaning is apparent, and the intent of the writer ignored. When the
intent of my writing which is positive, clarifying, or otherwise
educational in intent is discarded on grounds that it is critical, or
other grounds that are within the normal methods of teaching and artful
thinking. This comment isn’t to expand on the conversation of what is
trolling and what isn’t. It’s merely to show how I reasonably think you
are in here as a troll. Sometimes trolling activities are ‘covered up’
by pretense of ‘genuine or honesty in reaction’, whereas in my
experience this is used to exculpate the troll and for the troll to
pretend suddenly they are not a troll, and are really trying to
contribute. Trolling in fishing is a method of catching fish and
stringing them along another direction. It’s related to ‘red herring’
too, and often has hopes of guiding more than one person off track.”

The Significance of Ideas and Creativity.
</h3>
<p>
<br /><img  class="ui huge center image transition visible" data-src="significance-and-idea-generation-mattanaw-1-web.jpg" src="significance-and-idea-generation-mattanaw-1-web.jpg"><br />
</p>
<p>
I was recently asked to do an interview on intelligence, and one of the
questions I encountered related to identification of people who are
frauds in the IQ Community.
</p>
<p>
My IQ has been verified again and again since youth with proctored exams
and is well established, although I did not join Mensa and IQ related
groups until later in life, after independently confirming with more
tests.
</p>
<p>
Significance is lost on people who are not as intelligent as they think
they are. I’m thinking cross-domain, multi-discipline connections to
diverse fields.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes when someone shares a significant new idea, I can identify
within seconds 5 or more applicable fields. But depending on the idea,
it might impact all fields.
</p>
<p>
Earlier I have written related information about creative generation and
the number of ideas that can spring to my mind and other minds in a
period of time. One might call this the “velocity of ideas”. I have
commented that periodically the velocity of ideas and their quality
greatly exceed the ability to record them on paper or record them using
any means whatsoever. Particularly if they include visual aspects that
would require “movie making of what’s in the mind” which is impossible
at the moment. Some few words are sometimes worth many pictures, and
some strings of pictures in video are sometimes worth many words. Either
way failure to record occurs.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, how does this relate to “The significance of ideas”.
</p>
<p>
If one has highly significant ideas the velocity of creativity is
greater than if there is a lower level of significance to the ideas.
</p>
<p>
Suppose one has a string of ideas each of which impacts many
disciplines. How does one quantify how many ideas have been had?
</p>
<p>
Now compare this with an idea for a product, or a product improvement,
or a business idea to fulfill a social need.
</p>
<p>
The latter could be quantified more easily as ideas approximating the
singular. Although they are still complex and include other ideas,
otherwise there would be little reason to believe the ideas have general
value, or have <em>significance</em>.
</p>
<p>
This leads us to the question as to what a single idea is. A single
idea, I will briefly explain, may be a very specific vision into filling
a hole in functionality. Something doesn’t work, and there is an
immediate insight into adding a component that would fix it in a
makeshift fashion.
</p>
<p>
Underlying this idea is still an admixture of unconscious mental events
corresponding to neurophysical alterations and motions, and changes of a
variety of types. So even underlying an idea that might be called a
single idea might be ideas or “proto-ideas” that are merely biological
actions. These could be considered unconscious ideas, but I would prefer
to keep ideas in the area of what is noticed introspectively.
</p>
<p>
But one can see how this differs, compared to say a string of ideas that
impact many things in diverse fields. These ideas drive hundreds or
thousands, or hundreds of thousands of other ideas, and the thinker
knows this. The thinker identifies those who can instantly recognize the
significance, because the significance is not recognizable without a
similar mind, and the thinker who had the ideas can tell if someone else
has really recognized it.
</p>
<p>
What requires more conversation is the decision as to whether or not
someone has “seen all of the significance” or “only part”. Depending on
the level of experience, someone you speak to can, really, notice more
significance in your ideas than you do. This is a reason for the fear of
idea theft: “This person, who is very smart, noticed the significance
and noticed it as well as they did because they are prepared to act on
it, and they moved forward to act on it.” In my case I worry little
about this because I do not meet anyone who can even act on my ideas,
and more than that, I have given up on trying to act on any of them in
particular because they are so numerous I don’t worry as much. But this
relates to the significance of ideas and their velocity.
</p>
<p>
Creativity is not all the same. Creativity in the domain of ideas that
relate to significance is what has value in the world. This is connected
with the velocity of idea generation and the measure of creative
intelligence between people. It is also a measure (one measure) of an
organization’s workforce. Significance is the sign that more ideas will
be generated and came along with the first idea, or were included within
it. Significance then is important for the determination of just how
creative a creative is, and the value of those creations in connection
with the world.
</p>
<p>
Another point I’m stumbling on here, is consilience and value. What is
the relationship of the significance of an idea in many domains and the
value of the idea in total. This implies that inderdisciplinary
consilience is a measure of the significance of an idea.

All Local Examples as Metaphors for the Universe.
</h3>
<p>
In cosmology we see the taking of experiences in local settings being
used to create explanations for the entire universe.
</p>
<p>
Confirmation of this can be done by exploring and researching
native/aboriginal explanations of nature. There are many examples, and
most share some similarities to what is seen in the book of Genesis,
although there is diversity, which is to be expected. In our current
society we are glad for these diversities, even when they apparently
falsify the entire approach and indicate our more general advancement
through primordial stages of thought to greater sophistication, which we
simultaneously value. While it is not the purpose of this writing to
discard the inputs of ancient thinking into history, it is part of the
purpose of this writing to make it history.
</p>
<p>
A huge mistake in modern throwback cosmological thinking is that
metaphors from local experiences are still used to explain wholes in
which no experience has ever been had, and that people think they can
still understand cosmology, as if it is a genuine topic for exploration
and not speculation. I do not think it is not an unworthy topic for
thinking about, however. It’s just not as explorable as one pretends it
is and one relies on metaphors from a local setting exclusively in the
pretense at arriving at an answer. Notice native cosmologies were taken
as unchangeable answers.
</p>
<p>
“You will not revise Genesis.”
</p>
<p>
An interesting idea I came to this afternoon is:
</p>
<p>
“Why not make all local examples as metaphors for the universe?”
</p>
<p>
We have to admit we’ve been simple minded in thinking how the universe
would be constructed based on our experience and constrained without any
thought the use of our metaphors, as though some are those that can be
used and others are excluded.
</p>
<p>
However a <em>very creative</em> person can see that a story of the
creation of the universe could be done with many subsets of the total
possible metaphors to everyday experience and not only those a shaman
has chosen. A creative person in impromptu can <em>run with</em> almost
any input whatsoever. What this means is that Genesis is a very simple
work to write, and many alternative cosmologies could, <em>and
have</em>, been written, and many more could– millions and billions
could. We could likely eventually use a computer to generate alternative
cosmologies, one per second, over and over, until finally we could see
they have little value, because in their diversity, all are
unconfirmable. Again, I like diversity, but I would like cosmologies to
be entries into our history of first attempts at explanations, that now
would be immediately discarded as easy and simple stories that can be
concocted by any creative who starts with certain aspects of everyday
experience that can be used to build a story.
</p>
<p>
But again, even in such a way of thinking, of taking examples from our
normal everyday lives, and moving it into the origins of the universe,
we are selective. “Light was separated from Darkness”, “Earth is an
egg”, and so on. But what we have not acknowledged is that maybe,
according to this line of thinking, anything is metaphorical of the
whole, and perhaps we have constrained ourselves by our imaginations and
what we like. Consider for example:
</p>
<p>
“The universe can be rewritten at any moment in specific locations by a
software engineer outside the universe.”
</p>
<p>
This would be an analogy to everyday experiences of a software engineer.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps we could say:
</p>
<p>
“The universe has begun with a limited mind, just like a business that
failed was created by a limited mind.”
</p>
<p>
I thought of that last one in about 5 seconds.
</p>
<p>
How many more could we think of? Many more.
</p>
<p>
But the point is people have chosen with no experience at all of the
environment that has created the universe, and we are constrained to our
own solar system, and can’t really get anywhere else. Then we tell
ourselves the universe is massive and unexplored, and there are so many
things to look forward to and places to explore, that we have never
been. But out ancestors acted like they were there already and witnessed
creation first hand, while getting the details of the Earth itself and
basics wrong, because their access to everyday experience was:
</p>
<p>
Primitive and animal and very small.
</p>
<p>
So I recommend, we try to do what they did, except on more experience,
just as animal because we are animals, but less animal, in the smallness
of experience. Now we can have entirely alternative stories of Genesis.
</p>
<p>
Practice writing Genesis yourself! Other versions. See what you come up
with. How much better or worse are your stories?
</p>
<p>
Draw upon everything in your experience and use it as a metaphor for the
whole.

<em>Minimal edits as usual</em>
</p>
<p>
How does one decide at what time it makes sense to expire the life of a
household pet, such as a cat or a dog? Do you choose on the basis of
insufficient funds or inability or lack of desire to provide further
care? From all I have heard about those who choose to exterminate their
pet ostensibly there is a strong desire to care for the pet but that
desire is offset by other concerns like financial well being. Never did
I believe all considerations were shared. One gets sick of caretaking.
</p>
<p>
Beyond this is the question of who terminates. Is the extirpation done
by dropping the pet off in the country hundreds of miles, or is it done
by leaving them outside to be in nature? Is it done by shooting it, or
drowning it, or using a method that doesn’t cost anything, that might be
effective. Or do you choose to pay someone? Who?
</p>
<p>
Enters the animal doctor. The animal doctor is the doctor Kevorkian of
the medical community, that’s not quite the medical community. Maybe it
has quite a lot more to offer, like drugs that are cheap and still work.
Nevertheless, they offer a death service and they get paid for it. Do
they pressure death by offering forced choice situations between easy
path to the dogfood plant or a costly surgical procedure they are not a
specialist for? Are they general practitioners or death advocates?
Either way there is a conflict of interest strong enough to ensure they
feel guilty at times about their honesty and quality of salesmanship.
</p>
<p>
What could support us in finding a better way that finally care for our
pets in a way that is rational, and maybe gets better and not worse over
time? Well, one method would be to have a preplanned process diagram or
software game that allows the user to consider the true conditions of
the situations and probabilities, and see the quality of life outcomes
for all involved and the costs. Done well, everyone feels better about
their having not been completely alone and ignorant in their decision
making, or if not ignorant, not pressured and not short on time to
figure it all out. Such a “death calculator” or “euthanasia helper”
would allow for one to really feel confident that a conflict of interest
with a paid part-time killer doesn’t get in the way. It can also ensure
that you don’t become a killer with the wrong strategy. I said wrong
strategy because killing can be free and can amount to high quality
“sedation to death”.
</p>
<p>
Now, lets switch to the real topic. I hope this is helpful for planning
the deaths of pets but this is for your death. People have decided for
religious and other reasons to leave their deaths open-ended without any
planning at all, thinking that health issues will determine the result.
We don’t plan which health issues should do it, or are worthy of
choosing for us, which means you’ll take any condition to the end. There
is a conflict of interest with the humans who get paid while you die, or
who get paid for something related. You can’t insure yourself for
suicide. Dr. Kevorkian was locked up and placed into prison for
attempting to provide aid to elderly who wanted to leave like your pet
would. Happy and sedated, free of severe injury or unlivable health
condition.
</p>
<p>
What is the solution for this?
</p>
<p>
A death calculator, put in the crudest terms, because whatever the terms
we use are, amount to a plan that is conditions, probabilities, and
logical statements leading to a recommendation or set of
recommendations. If you have figured it all out, and have become the
calculator yourself, then you are the human embodiment of what is
needed. However, it is needed for it to be written, to be objective,
modifiable and traceable, and historical. It needs to help as many as it
can. Notice our system chose the same. It chose to help everyone by
doing very little–by steering all to the hospital, where the human
doctors make mistakes and decisions for you, with unknown processes and
payments.

Yeah I think so, and have been hearing confessions from some in some
locations that they felt they could not comprehend [in the High
Intelligence Community], but the thing is that is why we are in these
groups. But it’s always up to them too, I mean I understand that. So no
hard feelings with any of those folks if you talk with them, and if
anyone else raises anything, tell them I would understand but would
suggest that they pause me instead of blocking me. Because as things
progress the topics will certainly come swinging around to be
progressive (or conservative in the right way), depending on how you
view things.

The “penis hand” post was ridiculous obviously. But what is meant is not
so ridiculous. It was meant to highlight the potential differences that
can occur in sexual selectivity due to interesting arrivals of traits,

Alaska is slowly becoming more and more vegan.
</p>
<p>
I do not believe veganism is incompatible with lifestyles that diminish
meat until there is no factory farming and it’s all kindness. Although
I’d feel skeptical about what is really ocurring.
</p>
<p>
This mindset is not incompatible with veganism but factory farming is.
</p>
<p>
I started a book called “Being Vegan” when I first lived in Anchorage in
2009, and became vegetarian just before Thanksgiving 2000, and Vegan in
January 2001.

Soon maybe we’ll be keeping pace here in Alaska too. It doesn’t not

<h3 id="when-you-loved-your-own-post-did-you-love-you-but-not-like-you">
When you loved your own post, did you “Love you but not like you?”
</h3>
<p>
I agree this is kinda possible, because you could, if you’re not me,
want to care for yourself honestly, and still think also, that there is
something not likeable in yourself. You wish you were different and
further along, or had a chance to alter yourself, but you can’t, but you
still deeply care. So I can see that you can love someone and not like
them potentially, despite prior posts. I think though, that this usage
is an intellectual process blocker, because what is meant is specific,
and focused to specific experiences, and very often it is better to see
like as more middle in the spectrum to love. That’s what the button here
on FB is in large part. The heart hug is closer to concern and desire
for care. We have three “like” buttons of a sort. I could even say “I
like myself but I don’t like myself.” Because the focus of one like is
my whole life, and my attitude is positive, whereas, in a moment, I may
not really like who I am (not me really though). Notice that in moments
where you might “love but not like yourself” would be specific times,
where you don’t like something specific about yourself. But you love
“like” the whole.
</p>
<p>
Now let us conclude then. That you could redefine all love included in
these situations by a scale of liking if you wanted to, with discrete
time boundaries and frequencies, and specific situations. This is an
incomplete analysis so by all, think “huge portion” of uses.
</p>
<p>
If I say I love you then I like you too.

<h3 id="could-it-be-that-ebonics-is-just-english">
Could it be that Ebonics is just English?
</h3>
<p>
Let us consider that Ebonics, which is the formerly suggested name for a
subset of English that is used, and mastered by African Americans, and
those who closely associate with their culture, including perhaps, to
some degree myself, is actually just English.
</p>
<p>
Ebonics expands on the usage within English. It gives flexibility and
power in expression, and opens inventiveness that is celebrated in
certain writers who are responsible for those coinages that we rely on
in the etymologies provided in the Oxford English Dictionary.
</p>
<p>
In this way, those who involve themselves in Black Culture are doing a
service to the entire culture, in a similar way we knew they were doing
all along, in their inventiveness which is evident in entertainment of
all kinds.
</p>
<p>
Consider I have written a post criticizing the Western World for having
become thoroughly entertained. And we enjoy this. Our teachings come
from it, after we leave school, fail to read, and resume only listening
to music and observing entertainment.
</p>
<p>
Now imagine you are the English teacher who has neglected Ebonics, and
Black Culture entirely, along with all those who enjoy it, and imagine
themselves a part of it. It extends through all entertainment, back in
time, to before they were acknowledged in any way, and worse still, were
slaves ignored.

Enabling the Dalai Llama
</h3>
<p>
While many focus on the Dalai LLama’s supposed expertise from a long
life lived as a Buddhist beginning as a person named as leader of Tibet,
believing that somehow he has special insight into spiritualism, I’ve
become focused on his being falsepathed from youth. I am certain that
the Dalai Llama has not sustained sufficient honest criticism. I don’t
mean that we should damage his life by attacking his credibility
completely and entirely, but we should have actually paid attention,
instead of giving him complete credulity. What we’ve actually done is
enabled as system that pretended he was an expert at birth; a system
that forced him on a false path of being restricted to only one religion
and worldview, and actually, only one manner of dress. He has been
required to wear a single costume since he was a small child. A movie
was made, starring a very famous movie star, depicting his life as a
child, and even in this movie, which is favorable to him, proably in
ways that are truly to his credit, since he was living in hard
conditions and could have been killed, if the history is at all correct.
But the weightiness of his situation does <em>nothing</em> to make his
worldview true. The only thing that makes his worldview true or not is
the extent to which is is true, in correspondence with reality. Can all
his views and his person be demonstrated, or can they be thought to be
reasonably reflective of, reality, with very few falsities. I’m typing
not feeling particularly well at the moment, and so I would not make the
prior statement my final statement about how to evaluate a person with
respect to their level of development, in honesty, and value as a
supposedly actualized figure.
</p>
<p>
To make it more clear, I have read some from the Dalai Llama and have
heard his statements, and I think he’s really very profound at times in
his insights. Nevertheless, he has been falsepathed into a single
religion, and has been required to protect a people from demise. Thus he
is biased, but I think we can understand, why he would be biased,
wanting to protect people from potential genocide. Again, this does not
save his religious point of view. His religious point of view, from what
I’ve seen, is primitive. And his people were very low in the maturity of
a developing civilization.
</p>
<p>
If I were to survey all he did, and all he wrote, I could probably write
a similar short article on all that is excellent in his worldview, and I
think he appears to be a dignified leader, offering really valuable
ideas and historical perspective. This article though is more important
than that, because that is the <em>only</em> thing I have seen anyone do
for him, without knowing much about him; although, probably, within the
Church or in other religions, he has been made a fool, since I’ve
witnessed Christians pretend that Buddha is a fool, without having read
any Buddhism at all.
</p>
<p>
This article is about how he is a special exemplar of being controlled
in his youth, potentially to the extent that he is stuck in a worldview
not of his making. I have no idea if he is creative enough to break free
of his religion by binding religions and creating one of his own, which
is what I’ve done (although what I’ve done borrows and is in keeping
with Philosophy and Science and growth of Knowledge). It appears he
would not be able to do this, and that he does not want to, but I don’t
know of the pressures that exist on his decisions. But if it is the case
that he can’t on that account, isn’t a sad thing, that he is stuck
forever as a Tibetan Buddhist, from birth? There are so many other
options of how one could be, and one could combine these options. But it
appears he is very much forced to be a single category of person, within
a category he himself did not create.
</p>
<p>
Which aspects of his life appear to be problematic in relation to excess
singularity in worldview and action?
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Firstly his manner of dress.</em> It is a costume, or a range of
costumes of a similar type.
</li>
<li>
<em>One Nationed.</em> He is Tibetan and not a completely global
citizen. He is of a nation.
</li>
<li>
<em>Starting point is the end point.</em> He had a tutor to provide some
international education in youth, but he does not have the appearance of
an interdisciplinary professional, arriving at actualization. Instead,
it appears he started with pretend actualization and held onto it. But
that does not mean he has not learned more–I think it’s contrary to
that. But the completion point was taken to be the starting point. Baby
mangered.
</li>
<li>
<em>It is ignored that he was really a baby.</em>
</li>
<li>
<em>Separated himself from enemies.</em> He doesn’t appear to identify
with his enemy, as an American fails to identify with other nations.
Even in war, you are a Jap to an extent, and you are a Sand
Nigger.However, he may want to. But his manner of living is greatly
compartmentalized.
</li>
<li>
<em>Chosen Religion.</em> I was focusing mostly on his mode of life, and
appearance, but he has also accepted Buddhism. This means that he
himself has a chosen leader at the origin, and in this respect he isn’t
very different from anyone else who has chosen a religion. But he chose
one. You don’t even need to choose anything that’s already been
completed as a singular worldview, because the arrival is a very high
level of knowledge that is a reflection of actual truth.
</li>
<li>
<em>Controlled by a region.</em> He seems to be controlled by his
earliest environment, and they were from one region.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The big strength of the Dalai Llama is that he is an international
Diplomat travelling extensively, and despite the above, I cannot claim
he does not become other people as he learns about them, or that they
don’t become him. However, the divisions in religions and nations
continue, and probably he has to protect “his people.”
</p>
<p>
From my perspective, though, his people are not even his people. They
are incidental to his early experiences and while he may want to protect
them, because it may be a horrible thing for his heritage to go extinct,
I do not believe he is totally responsible, and there are plenty of
others who can do the protecting. Can you imagine if you were born, and
forced into a religion, forced to wear their garb, and then forced to
protect them until death, all while leading your portion of your
religion? This is where we can quickly determine if you believe people
should be free and individual, if you are an American. I would suspect,
that you would think that the Dalai Llama is supposed to keep doing
whatever it is he is doing. But he was in an environment he did not
choose, he did not choose life, and like a “tabula rasa” baby, he was
implanted with cultural knowledge of his region. According to the
American worldview then, he should be able to select other options, and
go according to what he thinks will make him happiest. I would disagree
with this too, because one can be tricked into what will be the happiest
life, and I think most likely, he would choose, to be exactly what his
starting point decided for him was.

The Presence of Children
</h3>
<p>
<em>Written without edits, and no spell check functionality. Reasons for
this exist and are somewhat experimental. I will write more about this
in the future after I gather information and am motivated to consider it
thoroughly</em>
</p>
<p>
Roughly ten years ago it was still common to say if a woman dressed
inappropriately she “was getting what she deserved” if she ended up
being sexually assaulted or otherwise victimized, and depending on where
you live, or who you associate with, you may still find people saying
it. There is also a sense to it, that is factually accurate, which is
the cause of the continued use, and that relates to the increasing
attention you get if you dress provocatively. However, I find myself in
agreement with those who think this illustrates the problem that the
perpetrators pose, and that they can actually be increased in their
interest and edged towards doing wrong, simply by behaving and dressing
in a way that is free. As I say this I know I also need to tell you, I
did not ever agree with the view that “People get what they deserve”
from simply doing what they freely would like to do. I don’t even agree
that the concept of “desert” has a solid foundation. But that’s for
another time.
</p>
<p>
For this occasion, what I’m wanting to talk about is the seemingly
unrelated topic of how such a perspective impacts involvement and
presence of people who would benefit from being included, and who would
benefit all those others, who are not of the psychological type to
commit acts of molestation and predation. This topic is that of the hard
boundary we create between adult life and the lives of children; and
what applies to children, you will see, applies to women. With this we
have a framework of sorts because we then have a gradient or spectrum,
and not just a single case along that spectrum, involving women who want
to dress provacatively. Did we not want to include women who wanted to
be included, however they wanted to dress? Why dissuade regularly
dressed women from being in public for fright, relating to risks of
being predated upon, because statistically, a women who is raped,
increases the expectation that any women would be raped, when
probability is conducted with less information, and not total
information.
</p>
<p>
I am writing this at a bar at the moment, in Eagle River, Alaska, and
while it functions as a restaruant, for families at various times, it is
also more adult at other times. Other bars function completely as venues
for adults after a certain time, as all know, and one cannot even join
in, without having identity verification with an age above 18 at the
lowest, and above 21 for the usual. What this means is that we do not
think anyone younger should participate.
</p>
<p>
Not all of the reasons for not wanting them to participate relate to
their risk of being predated, because what we are actually attempting to
do is create a semi-private space to behave in ways that even we think
are unacceptable to ourselves, in addition to those categories of
private and social interaction that we feel children should be protected
from, even if reasonable for older people. We made this decision as to
who can and who cannot engage in these actions by using a concept of
“adulthood” and we set a milestone as a single date (or 18/21 for two
categories), instead of considering interpersonal differeces.
</p>
<p>
But some reasons do relate to predation. We know women are predated on.
We do not want to include children in situations in which they can be
confused as potential mates, or be in situations in which men or women
are already of a state of mind which is not easily switched from, to be
non-sexual. Since we consider any sexual advances towards children to be
predatory, we created a hard boundary. So they are not allowed to enter
these environments where they might be at risk; not only at risk of
receiving sexual advances, but of giving them. They are also protected,
we think, of becoming like us. I would like to develop that topic
further, but maybe another time. For now I’ll say that if they were
present, but we were not predatory, and understanding of their potential
range of actions, we would probably behave more wisely, and then, they
would be exposed to almost all adult human types of behavior, and learn
how to behave in a way, that is less predatory too, and safer. Moreover,
they could have their own space for doing it, since even that admits of
degrees. Children enjoy music and can learn from adults being adults,
and not only adults pretending to be kids, or adults acting in a
constrained and somewhat false fashion, always and all the time in their
presence.
</p>
<p>
So the presence of children can improve us even when we are acting as
adults. But this has not been explored thoroughly.
</p>
<p>
The reader may feel shocked by this observation, or suggestion, that we
go on a new course in this area of our adult lives. But consider, there
is no such division in certain situations, at home parties, where
cousins and more distant relatives collide and sometiems find privacy,
but also at weddings, and reception parties, and all sorts of other
social events, where those same sexual behaviors emerge. This creates a
unique risk, because not only are adults not trained on how to behave in
these new situations, there is a sudden intermixing of adult and
youthful behavior. I think this is an area where there is insufficient
data and experience to know what happens; but it’s probably an area
where entertainment professionals could tell us more about what goes on.
Children drink alcohol in these situations.
</p>
<p>
Finally, we can move to the main point related to my thesis concerning
the need to be inclusive, and allow for the presence of people, we think
might be at risk. They might not “ask to be predated upon” by bing women
dressed a certain way, or children or teens who might be even more
attractive, but might simply be those who <em>would be</em> predated
upon, because of the nature of predators, who are untrained in normal
behavior. Infrequent stimulation of predators could be related to
infrequent sudden uncontrolled impulsive behavior. More importantly,
though, I want to convey that they are the problem. That is what the
movement is about, or submovement, or activism concerning the need to
free the victim from the predator. The predator has the problem and
everyone else should feel like they are able to be present and involved
in all sorts of social situations, otherwise, the predator has access,
but they do not.
</p>
<p>
Have we not considered that predators are granted access to behave
however they like, and be present and included in all events; whereas
everyone else ends up “asking to be a victim” or else, is told they are
merely increasing their risk to become victimized? And their freedom is
diminished, and their good judgement called to question. I can tell
there are many major consequences aside from these, but they relate to
the fact that we are controlling where free people can be, and are quick
to judge their minds, because predators exist.

<p>
Mattanaw cannot be understood without taking this program.
</p>
<p>
Yes, it is true, Mattanaw provides useful and interesting postings that
may provide some information around Mattanaw’s religion and philosophy,
but it cannot be fully known, and he cannot be understood, until the
certification program has been completed.
</p>
<p>
Some simple elements of the certification program.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Students must read his entire website, which is roughly 250,000 words at
present.
</li>
<li>
Students will receive additional materials, not currently published on
his website, providing greater insight into his philosophy.
</li>
<li>
Students will be certified according to their understanding of
Mattanaw’s mind afterwards.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
If you would like to join the certification program, please send a one
time donation of
</p>
<p>
$12,000 USD
</p>
<p>
to

<p>
You can expect a response within one week.
</p>
<p>
Readers are not discouraged from reading. Like many readers, the site
may only be of periodic interest.
</p>
<p>
However, Mattanaw cannot be claimed to have been “understood” without
certification, in any context, including any legal context, to the
extent, but not limited to this extent, that any excerpt read in
isolation could be grossly misinterpreted. Mattanaw’s writings cannot
have legal meaning without full knowledge achievable in the
certification program.
</p>
<p>
Substantial aptitude is required for full understanding. However,
Mattanaw will still provide certification for a subset of his mind, for
those who are unable to complete the entire certification.
</p>
<p>
Additional details will be provided upon receiving donation, and
donations are refundable if one decides not to begin the program, after
considering the new information received.

<p>
a movement.
</p>

What do you think?
</p>
<p>
…
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<em>[Aside: After some questions in a group to clarify the meaning of
the suggestion to promote non-vegetarians as Cageists (since it was not
spelled out), I included the following response]</em>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Hello all, explaining some more. It is not necessary to allow
non-vegan/vegetarians to have a non label, if they are not willing to
understand yours. You can feel free to ascribe to them a label that
seems appropriate to their system. That system has thoroughly included
cages all over, from within the industrial factory farms, to cages of
pets, to cages of zoo animals, to cages for fishing crab, and if one
includes nets as a form of fabric cage, then they are caging fish. The
entire animal agriculture system relies on entrapment.
</p>
<p>
So what I’m suggesting here is we think of them as “Cageists.”
</p>
<p>
They’ll try to argue that whatever a vegetarian is doing is fanatical or
unusual, and they’ll claim that vegetarians and vegans are excessively
open about their diets and views, even when that is not the case. For
those who are not honest, and not kind/polite, I suggest reminding them
they are
</p>
<p>
Cageists.
</p>
<p>
Vegans/vegetarians would not be cageists, and the difference is very
stark.

<h3 id="pretending-youre-backed-by-science-and-recollection-people">
Pretending you’re backed by science, and “Recollection People”
</h3>
<p>
How would you characterize your reactions to postings involving
scientific points of interest, challenging current social norms?
</p>
<p>
A trend I noticed, is that people tend to respond with their own
recollections of related points, or will respond according to social
norms, pretending they are backed by science or are familiar with the
science, or that they have knowledge akin to that espoused by
authorities, which they also do not know or understand.
</p>
<p>
Social recollections might be one harmful form of recollection that is
used in the place of thinking. I would add these to what I recently
thought of as “traditional” or “cultural” recollections, which are also
used in the place of thinking as reactions to challenges.
</p>
<p>
This might be helpful for understanding why political posts, or posts
challenging social customs don’t go anywhere. Most responses are types
of
</p>
<p>
recollection.
</p>
<p>
People are happy to remember and speak about it quickly, and if one
thinks about it, willingness to talk about something does require quick
loading of memories–otherwise speech would not be possible. Speech
includes recollection. However, it does not appear that speech requires
much processing.
</p>
<p>
If you look at what people respond, you can work to parse out what is
recollection and what involved processing, because whatever involved
recollection would be “I thought of this before” or it would be
identical with something someone else taught or communicated (i.e. the
social and the traditional). This means you can listen to what someone
is saying and find where the processing is.
</p>
<p>
Over time I find myself wanting to avoid those who avoid processing,
because I do not wish to converse with socio-traditional recollection
people. Another category that I mentioned before are what I called “fact
people”–people who pretend intelligence by recalling various facts
without any additional processing.
</p>
<p>
Here is when I can say “fill in the blank”.
</p>
<p>
So some recognition of a relationship has occurred, but I think this is
related to simple speaking and communication, because that seems to be
associative, and only requires loose relations. So there is the
recognition that something might relate, but not really relevance in
many cases. Usually it’s speaking recollections with very little
processing.
</p>
<p>
Certainly there can be no expectation that people will be continually
processing information without at times relying on recollections as they
arise to the mind, but I do find myself preferring people who are not
just recollection people. Recollection people are biased by availability
of certain facts ready to be spoken.

Races as Early Speciation, and Penis Size
</h3>
<p>
<em>Only minor edits. Relates to work pending on the value of
editing.</em>
</p>
<p>
The pervasive resistance to accept race as an obvious feature in human
divergence is an issue needing permanent correction, particularly now
that we already well-understand the effects of isolation across
continents, what species are, and how genetics works.
</p>
<p>
I suggest we create a list of topics we all believe could be easily
concluded at our current state of knowledge, and that this topic is one
of those, that we resist, not because we don’t have adequate expertise,
but because we are biased in the wrong direction due to social concerns.
</p>
<p>
Before saying more, I want to first mention, that I’m quite aware, that
with the blending of peoples over a long history, but in more recent
times, because of human population migrations, and effects of warfare,
it isn’t entirely simple to cleanly break people into racial categories
on appearance; and we should not even attempt to do so.
</p>
<p>
This area of lack of discernibility of singular races between groups due
to their intermixing is where those who complain that there are no races
at all tend to focus; but they focus here without giving us any
additional clarity and detail, about what has happened to the races,
which were formerly more discernible, because of their long term
isolation. For example, at one point in time, Japanese would have been
much more distinctly separate in appearance, and even if today, we can
claim, they’ve become more mixed with other races, such that they are
less identifiable visually, this does not mean that, historically,
visual identification would have been easy, and certainly would have
been due to the characteristics of their biology, and results of their
sexual preferences, and restricted population pool for sexual
intermixing.
</p>
<p>
Darwinian evolutionary theory on speciation, which is not out of date,
and will not be, at least until we begin to procreate via scientific
methods more commonly (i.e. we decide to inseminate instead of have sex
with each other), is still the guide for how we should see history with
the detail necessary to understand race.
</p>
<p>
Again, race was more clear historically, and only now became an object
of questioning, due to the desire to progress our society towards mutual
appreciation and tolerance, and to remove ill effects of excess emphasis
on appearance alone, particularly because we have not been able to erase
messages, and memories, of prejudiced ways of thinking, which still
spring to mind, and can be measurably detected, even in youth today,
even if they might claim it no longer exists. It has not been erased
from culture, and speaking for myself, my mind still generates
recollections, often at unwanted times, of thoughts that are not
desirable, because at an intellectual level, they seem irrational, but
still exist in my history, from exposure to my culture. Additionally,
these ways of thinking tend to arise when we are combative, and there is
no claiming that we have erased from the brains of our population these
thoughts we would prefer we did not have.
</p>
<p>
Fortunately the longer portion of this post involves this prelude to the
main conversation, but unfortunately, all of the time spent is in
preparing an audience that would probably be unreceptive, again due to
bias. Consistent with prior posts in this ThoughtStream, only recently,
you’ll see I’ve discussed that your biases are recollections of more
recent cultural teachings. If you are of a thinking disposition, meaning
you are willing to process information and not only recollect according
to your attitudes to what you hear, then I think you will find this
point of view has more explanatory power, and is consistent with other
experiences you’ve had, that would have been otherwise very difficult to
explain. Moreover, this interpretation is more in line with our
scientific expertise, even though, pseudo-experts, who have social
commitments, and those who are too unintelligent to understand their own
professions, may espouse what is simply the expected recollections.
</p>
<p>
<em>Speciation in Dogs</em>.
</p>
<p>
The primary defining feature of a species is that it only intermixes and
does not successfully intermix with others. However, even here there are
overlaps, and there are occasional successes, but sometimes there is
infertility. An example is with Horses and close relatives of horses,
and probably there are many examples over the animal kingdom, but since
we cannot frequently see animals behaving sexually, it’s not something
we would have good data on. We do not even have data on our own
sexuality, because we hide it. How much more hidden is it, for all
species on earth, which we cannot observe at a distance, and could not
observe regarding sexuality, even if we were nearby. However, in or
ordinary experience, it appears clear, that there are quite hard limits
between species, and we do not expect to see blended animals all over.
Rather, we expect to see distinct species, and this is one reason why
early hypotheses about animal evolution stated that they were
unchangeable or immutable, and not mutable.
</p>
<p>
Simple observations of dogs indicate however, that it is very simple to
steer animal live along a trajectory, based on sexual controls, that
result in differences in appearance that can be quite large. We simply
call all these various breeds of dogs “dogs” because that is a simple
lay term, but what we have not observed, in greater detail, is how they
are able to behave sexually as a result, even if their populations are
intermixed.
</p>
<p>
Consider Mastiffs and Chihuahuas. These are very different breeds of
dogs, with very different appearances, and we continue to assume that
they are the same species. However, there is a limit in which this can
be true, considering interoperability of sex organs and desire. Mastiffs
could not be expected, due to a huge difference in size, to mate with
Chihuahuas. They would prefer Mastiffs. Even with a mix of large numbers
of both dogs in the same environment, they would mate within their own
groups, and not with each other. If this were to resume over thousands
of years, we would have animals, and I think we already have them, that
we would call different species. There are arguments that can be brought
concerning what could happen about mobility of traits if interstitially
sized breeds were included (mastiff traits going downward to Chihuahuas
over different generations of mating with dogs that are between them in
size). But what this does is complexify the pool for sexual selection.
One could easily separate them out, and isolate them, such that after a
period there are no other dogs, but Chihuahuas and Mastiffs, and forever
they would not mate together again.
</p>
<p>
To be more clear in relating this topic to human populations, let’s
consider the height and total size of the Mastiff and the size of the
smallest Mastiff’s penis. Consider that the size of a small Mastiff’s
penis would be quite large compared to that of the female Chihuahua’s
vaginal space. These would not be a good match, and furthermore, the way
that the dog actually mates would not work, because the Mastiff is
simply too tall to mount and hump the Chihuahua.
</p>
<p>
This is something to be tested in practice, although instantly one
believes it to be reasonable to conclude, on thought alone, that it is
not feasible; and even if feasible, we could make Mastiffs greater, and
Chihuahuas smaller, until it is totally impossible.
</p>
<p>
There are populations of males from Africa, who were isolated from
groups elsewhere, who operated on different cultural ideals about
appearance and sexuality, than many elsewhere. Left alone, they attained
penis sizes that are vastly greater than many other populations. Like
with breeds, their appearance was different and consistent to their
population pool, and earlier, there was less intermixing, with other
groups with obviously different features, like the Japanese. Now
consider, if like we dogs, these populations stayed separate longer. It
could arise, that in the Japanese, and emphasis on the smallness of
female frame could result in a very different sexual sizing than with
those isolated in Africa. Those in Africa, likewise could become taller,
with larger penises and larger vaginas, and this could continue for many
thousands of years; or deliberately, if we were to want to try and test
our love of diversity, to the extent that we make our diversity so
great, that certain groups could not perform sexually, and would not
enjoy intermixing. Because it is not only inabilities to match by size
but inability to mate due to preferences.
</p>
<p>
Even today there are very large differences in preferences, and these
relate to appearances, which are different, due to intermixing and
breeding in regional isolation.
</p>
<p>
This post, in conclusion, indicates that humans were, in fact,
divergently moving in different directions affecting appearance and that
this affect of appearance relates to sexuality. It does not only relate
to skin color. Today we have the remnants of these differences, and even
if it is not clear to separate races as it is with different species,
historical differences in regional populations still exist and are
somewhat separable at the trait level. I suggest this is pronounced when
it comes to penis size and that we’ve been in denial about this
difference as we’ve focused only on skin color as an indicator of race,
and that, while there’s more to be said about it, our inability to
relate results from sexual differences which also relate to speciation.
</p>
<p>
When populations are intermixed, there can be a very dramatic shift in
preference. For example, if there is a match between Japanese women, and
African males, there could be a very big shift in preference from a
desire for certain other characteristics to others. It would be expected
that affected populations would react culturally to try to prevent a
very big shift in sexual behavior, and even the reasons for this
cultural shift could be hidden, particularly because sexuality is a
taboo topic, and this would explain, why in the United States, we do not
have a good understanding of the bodily variations apart from what is
uncovered.
</p>
<p>
And we are covered.

<p>
[Aside: As an afterthought, I would add, that taboo topics such as this
lead to a cultural intelligence drop, due to inability to communicate
and process, roughly analagous to what occurs at the individual level.
People who refuse to address certain topics are unable to process them,
and make use of their intelligence in the same way they would with
topics that are less threatening.]

<p>
…yeah I’m aware of what Chirality is. I suppose I should admit that the
application of the term to different domains according to the definition
given in the second paragraph is acceptable, but to my mind, this does
not indicate a chiral pattern, and a kind of reductionist phenomenon.
And maybe it shouldn’t be considered one. But such a collection would
serve to indicate the problems and patterns are related, while I would
claim perhaps the relationship is a superficial one. Meaning we
collected and aggregated these “chiral” examples, but perhaps have
mislead ourselves into thinking they are related in a way, that the
underlying causality would automatically have analogy, and that there
would be an underlying pattern we may also call “chirality”. Probably
these levels would confound. The mix of Chemical examples with
Anatomical examples shows this I think. There is very little reason to
assume there is any underlying commin chirality, and they may not be
suitable analogies. If use of two hands coming together has a functional
result advantageous to an animal that involves growth that cannot be
perfectly symmetrical, although the function relies on symmetry at a
functional level (which might mean there is <em>no chirality</em> with
respect to the functional symmetry), it does not mean that it is related
by analogy to the chemical examples, except by superficial reason. It’s
ok, it just means that the collection is an aggregate. An aggregate that
can mislead though.
</p>
<p>
…to continue relating this to the above post. A pseudo-chiral problem
would be one that on the surface apprears to have something underlying
that is of interest relating to chirality. For these problems, having
identified chirality would be useless for identifying an underlying
pattern. Instead it would falsepath or distract. This might be called a
pseudo chiral problem. The problem Jade shared appears to be a genuine
chiral problem because chirality is not incidental, but important for
knowing the problem itself. And it is chemical, and in this domain it
seems more relevant. Taking it another direction. Asking why hands are
chiral might not be useful at all, and I think it probably isn’t. The
chiral item of interest is maybe more at the root, about why growth
results in uniform asymmetry. There are other issues as well, concerning
a metaphysical expectation of symmetry. In that case chirality is even
less interesting in its pervasiveness at a superficial level. (again
it’s not clear which chiral examples are similar, which is the point of
the OP. The superficial visual unconfirmed analogy (what is the essence
of the analogy, i.e the blueprint pattern?). It is more verbal than it
should be. I think I blueprint could be created using a graph that would
resemble chemical relationships, but it’s not clear of that blueprint
would have any utility at all. Maybe it would though…

</p>
<p>
I’m able to raise a 70 foot tower on my spot in Anchorage and am
comsidering buying either inexpensive prefabricated sections of antennae
scaffolding or materials to build one myself.
</p>
<p>
Cost and quality is an issue. It’s a new project and I’m not sure what
would be best value. Main requirements:
</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>
It must function as a good antenna platform providing the appropriate
antenna-like properties by default.
</li>
<li>
It must be able to support the maximum number of antenna related
projects (max spectrum).
</li>
<li>
It has to be durable and proven for maintenance and weatherizarion in a
windy environment. 100 mph gusts.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Even better would be if I can attach a windmill.

<p>
Any ideas?

End of Chess: Victory to White.
</h3>
<p>
Finally, after many years, I will very briefly, explain, with some
impatience, my distaste for chess.
</p>
<p>
You might complain, defending chess, that it has utility for use as a
serious source of illustrative analogies. While I have heard some such
analogies, they do not save the game, since it is easy to find other
analogies.
</p>
<p>
The game exists and so you find reasons to make it important.
</p>
<p>
Proofs on deterministic advantageousness of one starting position over
another, black or white, on a standard 8 x 8 chessboard are misguided,
focusing on all possible responses to various possible movements,
creating high demand on computing power, resulting in lack of finality
due to insufficient time to arrive at an answer.
</p>
<p>
You enjoy chess on the condition that it is too hard to figure out, but
not so difficult as to make strategizing elusive. Many of those who
dislike it find strategizing elusive.
</p>
<p>
Tic-tac-toe is a game of small scale, of low complexity, elusive to the
lower animals, but too simple for anyone to enjoy who has already
arrived at a complete understanding of the game, knowing that the
advantage goes to the first mover, who can never lose, as long as they
comprehend the game.
</p>
<p>
Notice the <em>scale</em> of the chessboard, which is arbitrary! You
have not chosen a 24 x 24 square board, with, say 14, unique pieces,
instead of 6!; nor did you choose a 2 x 6 board, with only two unique
pieces for each side!
</p>
<p>
And what we await is a proof relating to pattern and scale, and not
verification in complete games at large scale, involving all possible
movements, failing due to lack of computing power, and adequate time.
</p>
<p>
I’m not sure I will do more work than provide this as chess is no longer
of interest to me, and has not been of interest to me for more than 15
years:

The “Soul” is as primitive as you can get, you Animist!
</h3>
<p>
Before you know anything at all, you may wonder, what is it that makes
animals move, and enables them to feel?
</p>
<p>
Feeling your own body, and sensations coextensive with your limits, of
skin, you wonder what is the cause of the feeling, and what you are,
inside, and not only on the surface.
</p>
<p>
Instead of adopting the obvious answer that you are all that is
contained in your skin, you took those sensations and made them a
ghosty, equal to the shape of your body.
</p>
<p>
This means when you “Soul” you are committing to what might be claimed
to be nearly the least informed perspective. Instead of even seeing that
you are an animal self-contained, with all that produces what arises in
experience, you chose to create a ghost with unknown properties, and of
course, it is completely invented.
</p>
<p>
Moreover, you will find that those who “had a great soul” upon death,
were those who did not have great minds, otherwise you would celebrate
their minds, and something connected to reality, and not resort to
things that didn’t exist.
</p>
<p>
Consider if your soul were celebrated, that it is not even you!
</p>
<p>
Now if your soul were celebrated, but your soul had, supposedly,
properties you had, then you could celebrate you? In that case you might
be knowledgeable about biology and that all you were was actually in
your organism.
</p>
<p>
The soul is claimed by religions, but the soul long antedates religions.
So before you get offended, ask yourself,
</p>
<p>
why did you allow your ancestors to make you an Animist?

Omission reveals suicide is the norm, unless you don’t make any decision
at all.
</h3>
<p>
What everyone is really doing at the end of their lives is choosing to
suicide by doing nothing.
</p>
<p>
They are knowingly selecting the outcome they want, even if they are
leaving it somewhat open ended.
</p>
<p>
Whenever an omission seems to be important, it is considered to be a
factor in moral analysis, and not a non-factor.
</p>
<p>
What we have been doing, meaning many and nearly all of the deceased, in
the western world, where suicide is considered “sacrilege”, a word I
don’t even like to hear, is act like we are letting “nature take its
course” as if we did not decide on an outcome that seems more desirable
for us.
</p>
<p>
In other words, in the choice of how you die, your suicide, you opted to
let nature finish you.
</p>
<p>
You missed a couple things.
</p>
<p>
Firstly, you missed that nature does it even when you do it.
</p>
<p>
Secondly, you missed that you decided either way.
</p>
<p>
So henceforth, I will state that your suicide is “death by anything
health related”, due to your omission to use a more active method.
</p>
<p>
Try to convince yourself you didn’t decide.

id="not-understanding-einstein-or-the-very-intelligent-at-all"><a name="not-understanding-einstein-or-the-very-intelligent-at-all">Not
understanding Einstein or the Very Intelligent At All</a></h2>
<p>An interesting point about reading Einstein’s autobiography, which
was focused on, and included technical details, surrounding his thoughts
about the edges of his theory and his field, is how easy he is to
understand, if one has the mind equipped for such an understanding.</p>
<p>If one does not have a mind equipped for reading Einstein, however,
one will never know, ever, what he meant. His meaning was very
clear.</p>
<p>This made it clear to me today, that even writers in antiquity cannot
be understood today, and will not be understood by anyone, ever, until
mentally equipped. Which is never for most into the “foreseeable
future”, since that’s a few days.</p>
<p>This was made ever more clear to me, when I gave as a gift, a work of
Aristotle to a very close friend since childhood. I listened to his
views of Christianity for many years. Tolerated them to a large extent.
He told me he will not read this book, and more than this, that he
cannot understand it.</p>
<p>Yet he still thinks I’m going to listen to his same sales pitches
regarding his religion.</p>
<p>Nobody will understand Aristotle today who is not mentally equipped
to understand Aristotle. As old as it is, he is <em>inaccessible</em> to
certain minds.</p>
<p>My friend will forgive this because it was his decade’s long
indiscretion and his admission.</p>
<p>From this we can arrive at this short, but apt, heuristic, if not a
more solid rule:</p>
<p><em>If a mind is not equipped to understand, it will never
understand. Therefore, for any work produced by the mind, even if
sufficient communication be given, to make it clear what the creation is
about, and is, it will never be understood by a mind not equipped. Being
not time dependent, it applies to all of history and prehistory and
future. Such that anything created before, cannot be understood after,
and anything after, cannot be understood before.</em></p>
<p>This doesn’t mean you need to understand.</p>
<p>But compare all this with</p>
<p>“I’m a fool, but through some messiah I have learned the secrets of
all creation.”</p>
<p>You’ll never understand Einstein and he did not unlock all creation
for you.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>There are some interesting points I think about this observation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Everyone already knows this, but fails to accept it. They resort to
pretending to understand, while contradictorily lofting and praising his
<em>unattainable</em> intellect.</li>

it was a meme shared.</p>
<p>This was my response:</p>
<p>If the world were copied such that it could be repeated, simulated,
inspected, and so forth, history would be boring. But, sometimes it
would be cruel, and sometime s cheerful. Mostly very boring (well,
virtually nothing of interest is happening, and the general pattern is
“entirely natural” or “animal but mundane”).</p>

<p>Shouldn’t it be a somewhat simple matter to build a large structure

<p>I’m thinking of a tower, with many tunnels going from the surface
directly into space. Maybe objects are thrusted into space using
magnetics, like magnetic trains, but hurling things much faster than
that.</p>
<p>What is the minimum amount of material that could achieve this with a
stable result? (Just the shell first).</p>
<p>Imagine a minimal volcano going directly to space with the minimum
amount of material (first). Imagine massive tubes that start
horizontally, creating a place to gain speed, transitioning to vertical
position, directly to space. Like the magnetic train in China, and
proposed magnetic trains for underground transport via tubes. Huge
objects can then be hurled directly into space.</p>

<p>Videos of robotic mastery of feats that usually are done somewhat
poorly by humans supports my view that we are trending towards more
clear evidence of predetermination. Here I’m imagining a video I saw
recently, that included robots playing bowling and baseball. While we
might have difficulty rolling strikes, or hitting a baseball in a
certain direction, or hitting it at all if the pitcher is very talented,
robots can do this with ease. It’s a scale issue, and for a long time
I’ve found it to be obvious, but not easily explicable to others.</p>
<p>Consider, for example, that machines like these could roll dice and
flip coins in a way that would reveal that physics is quite predictable,
and that the randomness is the insertion of inconsistency and
complexity.</p>
<p>There could be some disagreement on the fringes about
predetermination in that even with precision, there is uncertainty, and
variation. With complexity, more. I think there is a very close
relationship between statistical trends, when they are onto something,
and are in fact trends, and mathematically definite representations.
Complexity appears to me to be the cause of the gap. Simple elegant
solutions with a character of near definite finality, as with Newtonian
mechanics, show how extremely predictable things are when elements are
isolated sufficiently for exact mathematical modeling.</p>
<p>Where things are more complex, we rely on statistical methods. I’m
not sure there is a fundamental cleave between statistical
representations and exact models, although I don’t think there’s been a
complete unification of physics regarding statistical methods and more
precise mathematical models. This is related to some of the reading I’ve
been doing lately on Quantum Mechanics and Einstein’s relativity.</p>

id="personal-identification-naming-and-species-membership"><a name="personal-identification-naming-and-species-membership">Personal
Identification, Naming, and Species Membership</a></h2>
<p>[Proper names have been experimentally written in small caps. Some
edits made from the original longhand for clarity.]</p>
<p>We have not come a long way in our methodology of naming our
children, and ourselves, as is apparent in having a two name system with
excessive repetition where there should be uniqueness, and no name at
all where higher family names are required, which should be repetitive
since they would be shared amongst very large numbers of people.</p>
<p>There is also an incredible inability to choose new and satisfying
names that are unique, and instead, people such as myself have names
that are shared with a huge number of other individuals, who, later in
life, would prefer to have a special and more individualized name. It
makes little sense to have many people in the same room, or in long term
relationships, as friends, colleagues, or as acquaintances, with the
same designations.</p>
<p>Two aspects of this immature naming convention interest me. The first
is the need for systematic uniqueness that would enable improved social
system functioning, and the second is the fact that taxonomies of our
animal kingdom taken down to the individual level, to the biological
signature of choice, which may be DNA, but is probably yet to be
determined, would satisfy both the requirements for uniqueness of names
and the goal of having a correct representation of the earth with
respect to the animal kingdom, down to the individual people we simply
refer to as human beings. Since clarity about Earth and its animal
objects would be more clearly represented, we would also have clarity
about the history of humans and animals, such that an ongoing confusion
about divergences and our racial history would come into clearer view.
One could not, knowing one’s name, not know ones lineage and
relationship with history and position in the biosphere.</p>
<p>Two related issues exist. Firstly, our methods of consistently
storing identity information between systems and institutions is in flux
and they cannot be synchronized. As a former software architect I can
see that this is and should be considered a computing problem, and
therefore the solutions to naming can and should be solved using
knowledge about mathematics and of computer science; however, since the
objective is to represent the earth and not only represent and identify
individuals, a second problem must be considered, or planned for, and
that problem is this: our taxonomy is not going by our latin/greek tree
of life, and even though improvements have since been made in taxonomy,
they have not yet become popular such that laypeople could recall it
effectively, and certainly have not yet become complete. What did it
take to have a complete taxonomy/model of the earth’s animal kingdoms?
Since we do not yet have, and may never have, complete knowledge of
animal life on earth, and do not have a complete representation at
present, and we cannot recover completely earth’s history, we can expect
modifications to the system as we learn more.</p>
<p>This means that a permanent commitment to a new naming convention is
not wanted or needed, but that we can make it both permanent in approach
including any number of human individuals to a date, and a flexibility
in design to plan periodic/required updates. Probably you can have a
totally unique name that will not change, because you are the object
that is not subdivided further. If we change this, and we might, it will
mean quite a lot has changed in our views about ourselves, and probably
I cannot even say “ourselves” honestly, and at that point this work may
be less interesting. However, I do think solutions to problems in the
future would still be extensions to this solution, and simply more
mathematical and more accurate as to available information about the
earth. Going above the individual name you would have that may never
change, upper structure in the path name to the root which has the name
earth, and other roots, such as our sun, and milky way, and universe,
would be expanded as more information is gained and this expansion would
correspond to increasing fidelity and resolution of our vision of the
universe and its relevant parts.</p>
<p>At maximum fidelity the earth’s representation would be identical to,
an exact partial description of the universe and its total history. A
sliver, from the beginning of the universe down to the named
individual.</p>
<p>In the near future you could even have the name “milky way” in your
name if we don’t opt to choose another less figurative designation.</p>

<p>It seems to me that Facebook and other media channels would benefit
from allowing users to report their perceived reality or unreality of
messages received, and instead of only relying upon their own fact
checkers, because validation of information is important not only for
improving news. More generally we want to understand detection of
falsity in any way it presents in our information channels.</p>
<p>If we value education I think we will head in this direction.</p>
<p>I hope it is used to counter false messages in advertising too, and
maybe the approach would help show what I’ve long noticed, that
advertising is fundamentally at odds with education, the way we do it,
and for some reason parents have been OK with the transition from
rationality and stability provided by good public education to adulthood
in lies and fabrication.</p>

Probability Next Thought, or High Probability Next Thought.</a></h2>
<p>Not too long ago I posted on our inability to know what next thought
we would have, and the challenge of knowing what to do next, that also,
is largely not within our control.</p>
<p>Another interesting topic involves the probabilities involved in your
next thoughts and acts of speech.</p>
<p>Everything you think and say that consists of words is a finite list
of words joined together. These sentences can be constructed of
simplistic words, and simplistic vocabulary, with simple intent, and
associations of thought, to the effect that they are quite easy to be
predicted.</p>
<p>Some people are cliché people. Saying the same things as the
next.</p>
<p>Some people are recollection people. People who hardly think of
anything new throughout the day, and simply remember prior thoughts.</p>
<p>Then there are clever people who construct novel sentences regularly
but of low complexity, short words size, plain combinations, short total
sentence length, and sentence quantity. Intent and total association
mighth be of low complexity too.</p>
<p>It is easy to see what type of measures and spectra would exist in
relation to this. Some are quite predictable in their thoughts and
change little from day to day, and say things that are nearly purely
copies of their earlier thoughts or thoughts of other people, and maybe
not too complex even in their recollections. In other words, they are
easier to store and remember too.</p>
<p>Others, however, are more adept at generating novel sentences, that
might not be recollections at all, and may be built from a history of
generating longer more sophisticated sentences, with words of longer
length, and intention of greater complexity.</p>
<p>This amounts to people who are producing less probable thoughts and
language.</p>
<p>This is not restricted to language but is evident in language, and is
largely measurable.</p>
<p>It has been stated that a book is simply one giant collection of one
arrangement of symbols. If a computer were leveraged to create all
combinations of symbols for a certain number of pages, then all books of
that length or less would be written by that computer, although they
would be hard to identify in the giant set of meaningless books also
created. Books that are shorter, comprised of easier language, copied
messages, and recollections, would be more easily predicted and
reproduced by a computer system, that places emphasis on existing
inforamtion including sentences already known, and simple words. But
minds that produce works that are less predictable, would certainly have
the traits of not using recollections as frequently, or copies of
sentences, and phrases that are more usual, and therefore a computer
system would have more trouble creating these works, particularly if
they are using a weighted system placing emphasis on simpler words and
simpler expressions.</p>
<p>One can consider the extent to which one would want to discourse with
another kind person, by similarity in the spectra of production of
language. We already value those who produce unexpected and meaningful
sentences of greater length and vocabulary, than those who obviously
have trouble producing thoughts in language of more repetitive and
obvious or expected constructions.</p>
<p>A test of this is the fact that you would not enjoy speaking with a
person you cuold predict easily from the very beginning meeting them, if
they are being open and are expressign themselves the way they would
when they are most generative and least predictable. These are people
who would instantly bore us because they would fail to surprise us any
longer, and therefore we would have fewer learning experiences in their
presence. We enjoy spending time with others, however, who are
sponteneously generative and are continuously surprising us as though
they themselves are sources of new and unexpected information, and are
like new experiences in the world on their own.</p>
<p>If someone, in advanced age, becomes more predictable than they were
in youth, the same effect would result, in that people would become
disinterested in their company, at a speed matching, perhaps, the speed
that they become known.</p>
<p>Some people, from this, we can see, are more unknowable than others,
because they continue to build, and create, with a level of
sophistication that can be far more than others. Our enjoyment of their
company may last as long as they are able to remain unknowable, and
provide continuous stimulation, and interesting novelties, so long as
what we are valuing is communication, and companionship, and not
something more, like novelty of experience in the outside world.
Although it is possible, to become more interesting in both domains, by
expanding the sponteneity and novelty of activities in the world, while
at the same time trying one’s best to remain creative and generative as
far as one is capable of doing so with one’s mind.</p>

parts of electronic devices off, and Computers containing numerous
separate systems.</a></h2>
<p>[Only minor edits.]</p>
<p>A major limitation on consumer and professional personal computer
products is the inability to have more than one start to the
computer.</p>
<p>At this point in time, computers have multiple processors, and
storage and hardware is inexpensive enough, and small enough, to live on
a watch or a phone. Being small and inexpensive, and easy to package,
there is no reason to not consider including more of each into the shell
of a laptop computer, that could presumably contain multiple phones.</p>
<p>Recently I began thinking more about related topics to this
considering the advertised performance of the processors in phones and
watches, and other devices, that provide no method for the end user to
truly benefit from those additions.</p>
<p>Why would anyone want to have a computer with multiple sets of
hardware? I can think of many reasons, but here are a few:</p>
<ul>
<li>I could separate client data completely into different compartments
on the same computer, and run them independently.</li>
<li>I could have an actively running webserver going at all times to
host my public website, and turn off the rest of the computer.</li>
<li>I could have more secure things stored one one computer internally,
and less secure things stored on another computer internally.</li>
<li>If I host a large number of VMs like a small data center, I have the
limitation that if I turn off my computer, my entire data center is
turned off, whereas, if my computer has many computers contained, I can
host as many VMs as the number of independent systems would allow,
without any need to turn them all off when I switch off the computer.
Again, I could be running a data center with a complex application on my
machine, even with internal networking, while my personal portion of the
computer would be off.</li>
<li>I could separate business from private.</li>
<li>I could charge different customers for use of different parts of my
computer, rather than carrying around multiple laptops.</li>
<li>I could protect others from risk.</li>
<li>A family could get more from one or two laptops, instead of having
to have many laptops, which certainly must be very expensive, for
families that cannot afford numerous computers for each and every family
member.</li>
<li>It would push us towards a more advanced understanding of computing
and networking at the individual level, such that all consumers/citizens
would be more well informed and potentially more capable for work in
software and technology, and therefore more competitive
internationally.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many other benefits, but have you ever wondered to
yourself, what does this on/off button do, and why can I not turn on and
off parts of a device, and not only the whole device?</p>

<p>For some reason people have come to the conclusion that “hate” is
some especially heinous condition of complete lack of any positive

it can become a more pervasive thing, and people can end up wanting
others to be eliminated, but I think we’re better off allowing certain
forms of hatred and frowning on others, so that at some point we can be
more discerning, and then the paradox you have above would dissolve

<h2 id="equal-to-the-disabled"><a name="equal-to-the-disabled">Equal to
the Disabled</a></h2>
<p>and the Self-evidence of Inequality.</p>
<p>I am allowed to exhibit the symptoms of anyone who has a
condition/disability, such that as a result, I am again valued equal to
them.</p>
<p>To give just one example. If someone has a parking space that’s very
close to a building, because they have trouble walking, I too can have
those symptoms of having trouble walking, and therefore, I restore
equality, and there can be no discrimination. Thus I can use handicapped
parking spaces, because I’m again equal to the handicapped.</p>
<p>The principle of equality is axiomatic in the United States of
American from its inception. This means I’m equal to any person who has
a disability, and means that I can express any symptoms a disabled
person would have, if I choose to, without any loss of value as a
person.</p>
<p>Accordingly there is no right to be heard. Because if I wish to be
deaf, or attentionally disabled, or “listening disabled”, then I can
fail to listen too, and just like any person with the disability, there
is no obligation of “listening” to anyone.</p>
<p>This and other paradoxes result in our insistence of “equality
morality”. False viewpoints can be shown to be false by a principle of
reductio ad absurdum, which is directly related to the formation of
paradoxes. The idea here is that we show that our commitments clash in
ways that reveal there cannot be consistency. Equality morality was said
to be “axiomatic” in our Declaration, but in fact, it results in obvious
paradoxes, and is the opposite of an axiom.</p>
<p>It is fascinating, that the opposite appears to be true, that
inequality is self-evident and axiomatic. For another example of this,
scroll down and view the posting on “One-oneths People”.</p>
<p>Equality depends on having valuations prepared, that when compared,
result in an identity in values. Our major issue is that we do not
actually compare any values, and wherever we do, inequality is found,
and not equality, when the precision is great enough. Inequality is so
obvious an extensive when values are taken, that it is self-evident that
equality is rare, an confined to comparisons where values are expected
to be identical, as in the exchange of currency or comparison of atomic
weights.</p>
<p>Additionally, there is no such thing as self-evidence, because for
anything that is concluded, there must be something else that must be
looked at. Nevertheless, for my purposes here, I use “self-evidence” to
mean “obvious” and in that case, inequality is obvious.</p>

<h2
id="youre-11ths-a-person."><a name="youre-one-oneths-a-person">You’re
1/1ths a Person.</a></h2>
<p>According to the Declaration of Independence, it’s axiomatic
(self-evident), that all two people are equal to each other. This means,
that we have taken a valuation of all individuals, such that their total
value, each taken, amounts to being 1/1th a person.</p>
<p>But it appears very readily, to almost anyone who “keeps it 100”,
that keeping it 100 is not the norm, hence that most are not equal with
respect to their honesty, and going by that measure, each person would
be a fraction of 100, and not 100/100, or 1/1.</p>
<p>This means that we cannot us honesty in our valuation of other
people. Because if another person’s keeping it 100 status was really
keeping it 70, then they would be 70/100, which would surely bring that
person’s valuation to be less than 1/1, also because everyone values
honesty in their estimation ofother people. So should we conclude that
there is a contradiction here (this is humorous and serious), that
instead of 1/1, a person who is only somewhat honest sould have a
reduced value, to something maybe only a little less than 1/1.</p>
<p>It is self-evident that people do not value each other equally, so it
is confusing that we have committed to a perspective that all people are
1/1th people.</p>
<p>Failing to observe the 1/1th person rule results in a reduction of
moral worth in our estimation, for failure to adhere to our perfect
equality morality.</p>
<p>Consider that in our history some people were considered 2/5ths
people. Now we believe them to be 1/1th people, but that anyone who
considered them to be 2/5ths people, are worthy of being erased from
history, since presumably, by their moral error, they themselves are
reduced from 1/1th people, to</p>
<p>0/1 people.</p>
<p>Who are 0/1 people?</p>
<p>These are the “cancelled” people.</p>

Important is Listening?</a></h2>
<p>[Aside: This was not my question, but my response below is mine]</p>
<p>Since you can be disabled, and totally deaf, I would say, it can have
very little importance, depending. Enforcing listening, because of
deafness, becomes a kind of social-insensitivity. If anyone were to
claim that I had a limitation because I did not listen, I would claim I
have as much rights as the deaf. Of course this is not intended to be a
complete and thorough answer to the question from all perspectives, but
if I can be deaf and listen to nothing, and we value the deaf, and they
are “equal”, then I am equal to the deaf, and am valued as much as they
are, when I listen and do not listen.</p>
<p>Notice that key premises in he above are axiomatic according the
United States Government, from its inception and very first official
document, its Declaration of Independence.</p>

id="priveleges-and-not-serving"><a name="priveleges-and-not-serving">Priveleges
and Not Serving</a></h2>
<p>[Only Minor Edits, Typed via Mobile]</p>
<p>With privileges you see that the purpose of life is not serving other
people. Self-described degenerates (sin). It’s hard to say if any one of
them is saying they believe it’s their purpose, or if they are saying
it’s someone else’s. Judging by behavior, it’s nearly nobody’s
purpose.</p>
<p>Personal betterment seems a better aim, and that way nobody can
weasel their way out.</p>
<p>Furthermore, one need not believe one is a degenerate permanently.
That is, you don’t need to be saved from anything.</p>
<p>The goal is partly to have others serve your interests so you can
progress further. We call it job creation although it’s socially
programmed to provide only modest advancement if any. Some are needed to
never advance since merit is supposed to allow others to be better than
others. If you never improve, you would never be better than yourself,
and therefore anyone like your unchanged self should not advance. That
would be “unfair” and so under this system that person remains in a more
“highly extracted” state, for the benefit of the persons being served,
including anyone above like managers, but most notably the owner.</p>
<p>I have no employees, but interestingly, since I’ve done well, some
push to employ, to share, but if I’m to do that, following the model
they have in mind, I would create a pyramid extracting value from
everyone beneath, growing myself at their benefit and expense, skewed
towards my benefit. I would build jobs, but they could never do what I
do of course, so I would be in a role that would never be passed to
another, and if so there would be one slot, for whoever I prejudicially
select, to fulfill my legacy (since others believe in legacy).</p>
<p>From all of this it is clear that the privileged do not find their
purpose in “serving others” or “serving the public” and that’s partly
because others think they shouldn’t, including everyone who thinks they
should hire to share. It’s not at all clear how else they should share,
because others want to merit it.</p>
<p>Going further, others desire fame. Fame depends on the limited
attention of people being aimed at a fewer number of individuals than
exists. The ratio is maybe 100 thousand to 8 billion. The fame aspired
to is fame of the United States, for the duration of the famous person’s
life if possible, since all is wellest that ends wellest. The best stars
die well and die while famous and their image is preserved. This amounts
to few to no individuals in the entire earth’s population. This fame
involves the requirement, then, that everyone on earth seeking the same
fame is prevented from having attention. People consume entertainment,
vote, and pay for this fame, which is fundamentally exclusive, and
self-promoting, and therefore they promote self-interested advancement
of the privileged, who are successful because they believe they serve
themselves. In other words, the values match the expectations, which is
a necessary condition for good marketing and success.</p>
<p>However, it is admitted, that one who includes the public interest in
at least a modicum, creating a palpable benefit people can feel, there
will be an even more popular opinion, and the additional attention
created will be entertaining and pleasing, but it cannot seem so good as
to cause boredom.</p>

<p>Cycling vs Walking</p>
<p>Or wheels vs pendula</p>
<p>Imagine you are told you will receive 1 million USD if you can walk
or cycle 2000 miles to a destination determined for you. You are told
both are easily walkable or cycleable with very little effort. You can
take as long as you want. The only catch is that you can never maintain
the bicycle, but if you choose the bicycle, the bicycle must make it to
the destination too, and you can never just walk.</p>
<p>There are no catches. When you find out about the destination, you
realize it is easy. If you live in a location with different terrain,
another starting point is provided that makes it easy. Everything else
is assumed to be covered including all costs.</p>
<p>The only requirement is that your feet will do all the walking, or
the bicycle will do all the driving.</p>
<p>Which do you choose?</p>
<p>….</p>
<p>What is the point of this? I’m reconsidering the bicycle as a worthy
method of getting around over a combination of walking, public
transportation, and driving/Uber, when the goal is to have a minimum
number of possessions for ease of movement. The bicycle seems to hard to
transport and to maintain.</p>
<p>Side topic:</p>
<p>There may be something more interesting about animals vs machines.
Because no animals have wheels and nature has opted for pendula.</p>
<p>When do you choose one or the other and when?</p>

<p>Too often, the question and the answer both were poor, and all I
would think about is that, and how to do all of it better, rather than
find the characters/symbols creating a psychological match to the

<p>I didn’t think about it until today, but it appears reptile ownership
is a loophole to commit acts of animal cruelty.</p>
<p>To illustrate, consider the odd case in which a guy was drowning cats
in plastic bags and posting videos. Apparently he may have been forced
to do this by a dangerous person (oddly enough), but until that was
known he was considered especially heinous.</p>
<p>Now consider that the average reptile owner can feed anything they
want to their pet. They can feed them chicks, hamsters, mice, guinea
pigs, and cats if they wanted to. They could feed them anything as far
as I know, and could watch while relishing the events again and again.
Because, of course, the reptiles need regular feedings and not feedings
in isolation.</p>
<p>So this can be far worse even than the guy who drowns baby cats.</p>
<p>What do you think about this odd loophole. Kill the cats by direct
strangulation, or kill them by strangling and crushing them with a boa
constrictor?</p>
<p>Or cage them in confinement with them unable to move, and slaughter
them, and grind their babies like how we do with chickens? Because we

<p>[Originally posted on Facebook to clarify some statements on this
topic for a FB friend]</p>
<p>[FB Friend Name Omitted], ok well I’ll send you the article too since
a few sentences won’t really do it. But In the meantime, I would say all
traits. Anything two characteristics two people can be measured on is
cause to value one person over another with respect to that trait. In
the market that’s what we do. If this is true for one trait, taken
separately, it’s true when they are present in aggregate (entire races),
and when combinations of traits are desirable.</p>
<p>For example, if you will film Black Panther, every white person on
earth is of no value for the lead role. This means individuals are ruled
out and the entire aggregate of all individuals with that trait, and in
that situation they are offered no job and no money, and so are
certainly devalued. If devalued then, they might be devalued for any
situation in which that presents, meaning more pervasive devaluation
occurs. When it comes to intelligence this is plainly true, because our
entire labor force and education system selects for this trait.</p>
<p>I’m not sure what trait cannot be valued or devalued meaningfully
depending on the contexts.</p>
<p>That’s how we hire. But, when a trait is irrelevant, we understand it
is questionable to value differently, all else being equal (although all
else is never equal either). What is annoying are bigots trying to
justify plain irrelevant selection to satisfy some other desire. We
identified some traits we really do not want people to consider for
valuing in employment decisions, and we are all familiar with that short
list now. Notice the list is short. This means it is legal to
discriminate on any other trait. I go beyond this and think all
irrelevant traits are irrelevant, but I have no way to enforce this. But
all else is allowable discrimination on the basis of unequal traits that
may not exist in entire populations. For example I would not hire you if
you cannot speak English or cannot speak effectively. This rules out all
of Asia from employment for the most part.</p>
<p>Really what I want to get to is a really subtle understanding of
justice founded on respect for diversity, although even that requires
considerable elaboration and I don’t even like stating it that way, but
it shows how diversity can be valued greatly amidst extensive
inequality, and I think it can support a more refined and satisfying
social justice with the idea of equality largely removed. (equality may
be an occasional litmus test of sorts for some systems, but would not be
the driver).</p>
<p>I hope this gives you a better idea what I mean, and since I depart
from the norm quite a lot of explanation and background is needed, and
in the article I do a better job of this I think. I see this as a
probably necessary progression because it clarifies everything whereas
ideas about equality do not.</p>

<p>As I continue to collect reasons supporting my position that editing
serves an instrumental purpose with a colleciton of strategies that have
not been spelled out, and must be sophisticated, and not simple and
global, and the same for all modes/mediums, I am finding more and more
support of my view, and not less.</p>
<p>The more educated reaction is not to immediately and summarily fault
communications due to blemishes.</p>
<p>Consider the experience of speaking to an imbecile who claims to fail
to understand a verbal communication, some might angrily say:</p>
<p>“Did I stutter?”</p>
<p>What does “Did I stutter” mean?</p>
<p>It means this: Why are you failing to understand something anyone
could easily interpret, or are you pretending to not understand, or are
you acting like you can’t understand because of some insignificant lack
of clarity?</p>
<p>There is more to it even than this, which is interesting, but the
main point is:</p>
<p>“Why can’t you understand this communication?”</p>
<p>This is an interesting example of taking the burden of editing off
oneself, and one’s message creation, and placing the burden of correct
interpretation, even through mistakes of speech, to the listener.</p>
<p>“Why do you fail to understand” could easily be transfered to the
reader.</p>
<p>why can’t you see that this misspelling, or extra comma, is easily
passed over by others, who are eager to understand.</p>
<p>Are you pretending to misunderstand, because of a typo?</p>
<p>Do you pretend to misunderstand, because of a typo?</p>
<p>Consider there is an art to defects as well (see below). This means I
may provide communications with defects artfully, and volunteer errors,
in writing, as in speech, not to diminish the meaning, but potentially
to enhance it.</p>

<p>I think if we go measure by measure of various traits that people
have, then certainly we will find that those measures vary, and we will
value those traits differentially, meaning that indeed, people are not
equal to each other, and that is more of a bias than a reality… but… I
think that also supports the idea that people are valuable
differentially, and that it’s good to have diversity for that reason,
over homogeneity. I’m not too sensitive about thinking someone is better
than me in one way or another, and I’m fine being better than others in
various ways too. Personally I think there is a cultural hangup on
equality, where folks want to find equality where it does not exist, and
want to hide interpersonal and cultural differences. I want to see the
differences, and I want to be able to value them differently depending.
After all, what amazement is there to be had about another culture, if
they don’t have something especially valuable and different, by
comparison with other things. We are trying to have good things that are
different from other cultures, while simultaneously pretending that
valuation is independent of these things. We are making comparisons,
will continue to do so, and there isn’t anything wrong with it, as long
as it is done correctly, and without other especially harmful forms of
bias (valuing entire people on the basis of some insignificant trait,
for example).</p>

effectively, sometimes I cannot. I can ask anyone in the place of
Google, but they oftentimes will have no answer either. Feynman seems to
be a person who will save you all the time, and that is massively huge.
He will take a question that is meaningless, or unanswerable to almost
anyone. Determine what is needed to answer it, translate it, change it,
even completely take it out of the picture as the wrong direction, which
means “some questions are not good questions” which is what we always
knew to be true. He then substitutes those questions with good ones,
ones that lead to the <em>most</em> meaningful answers. That’s what I
think I’m seeing happening here. An interesting question, is what would
be a technical solution to the garbage-in garbage-out question. Given
that Google cannot do this, and only select, highly impressive people
can, I think Feynman is doing something, that not only nobody can do (or
very few), technology is unable to do it as well, and it is honest!</p>

on the Art of Defects</a></h2>
<p>[From a response to a comment received on the related article below,
on Facebook. I thought this was worth sharing here as well. This is also
unedited.]</p>
<p>In this part of my blog, the entire thread in it, not just the
article, it is all considered a mandala of sorts, and part of the idea
behind it is that editing is not always necessary or desirable, and that
the mind itself is noncommittal, vacillating, and willing to abandon
trains of thought for others, and much of what we do in publications is
to cover this up, to give the impression that our thoughts themselves
are more complete and defect free than they are, and we are embarrassed
upon the discovery of small errors. Instead, we can, sometimes, be more
like how we are in everyday conversation which has a similar character
to our thoughts, in that we interrupt, adapt, vacillate, and err much of
the conversation, but in the end we come together sometimes and even
have emotional connection and mutual understanding through all the chaos
of imperfection, and it’s kinda sad that we don’t use the same approach
in written conversation.</p>

Defects</a></h2>

Audio</a></p>
<p>(This is mostly unedited. And there are reasons for that which I will
write about soon to explain why. So expect an error or two).</p>
<p>I continue to write many postings on this ThoughtStream with
unconcern for defects, occasional deliberate avoidance of editing, and a
feeling of tension between a desire for sharing my mind as it thinks,
through my fingers, and another desire, to share something without
flaws. But there are always flaws, because even the language is
flawed.</p>
<p>Today I was listening to a song that apparently had some deliberate
defects. A section didn’t sound right, seemingly on purpose, to create a
flaw, as a signature of sorts, or a message to the world “I’m in control
of this and I can insert what I like.”</p>
<p>There is an artfulness to defects that goes overlooked. In some ways
I have developed this art, but I know I have not summarized it. I think
there’s much more to it than is appreciated.</p>
<p>A painting has a signature, that mars the painting itself, for the
sake of including handwriting, with a pattern and color mismatching the
rest. “I’ve done this.”</p>
<p>Other paintings, more abstract, may have all sorts of deliberate
defects. Maybe a painting, nearly perfect, is destroyed as viewers are
enjoying it, as I’ve heard was done. Maybe another painting, seemingly
consistent, superimposes another painting, of another type, to provide
some alternative meaning, or to create a kind of juxtaposition or
tension.</p>
<p>There is no way to describe all the ways that “defects” may be added
into paintings and other forms of art deliberately, to convey meaning,
or to complete the art in a way, that at another level, a meta level, or
a meta-meta level (or some other abstract “level”) may reveal is more
consistent.</p>
<p>If I leave errors in this ThoughtStream, sometimes it is for a
similar reason, although not always. Sometimes, leaving errors, is
simply to provide an authentic datum. An edited work is an alteration.
But there is another point, that revealing to the reader flaws reveals
something about the writer “This is me, and I deliberately overlooked
this, so you’d see error, and perhaps judge me for it. But I’m also
hoping for that reader, who will notice, that I’ve shared my flaws, to
provide more information about myself, rather than to cover it all
up.</p>
<p>There is an art to defects. There is a mathematics to it. For myself,
I admit it’s not completely explored territory, but it is somewhat
contrary to editing, and that’s one reason why I include it here, to
further explore the meaning of not editing, but instead sharing. And as
I said before, spoken words are not edited, and we consistently overlook
defects, to find meaning we are trying to provide each other.</p>

<h2
id="same-religion-for-everyone-in-a-society."><a name="same-religion-for-everyone-in-a-society">Same
religion for everyone in a society.</a></h2>
<p>Another interesting issue with our inherited religions is that they
are perceived as solutions for everyone in a particular community.
Missionaries extend this view to the belief that the same religion is
for everyone.</p>
<p>A question that came to mind, while I was young, was whether or not
humans colonizing other planets would impose the same religion on other
species and if they would send missionaries. I do not believe in this
scenario, but I do think if there were sufficient similarity, humans
would do the same that they already did between continents, even in
scenarios where cultures were quite dissimilar.</p>
<p>The motivating idea for this post, however, was not the above
considerations, although is certainly related; that is, that people of
differing mental capacities and capabilities should find the same
religion satisfactory or pleasing or applicable to their lives.</p>
<p>I have never found religion satisfying and several friends commented
that it may not be for me (“too smart to accept”). Interestingly, some
advocates of religion will say that some have to have a certain
disposition or readiness to accept, making it seem that adherents
themselves don’t believe their religion is for everyone, while at the
same time, their leaders offer their religion as a single panacea for
all or a large portion of human problems.</p>
<p>It seems more obvious to me that diversity of dispositions would be
quite great and many simply would prefer alternatives.</p>
<p>That there are not more alternatives is a historical issue, and one
of intolerance between people and nations.</p>
<p>I reject religion myself, although I characterize my own philosophy
as my religion. It is not my expectation that I could formulate my point
of view in a way that would be instrumental or palatable, satisfactory
or understandable to all people. Rather, what I hope to achieve, is to
provide a way of thinking that is based on factual information, that is
truthful to such an extent that it is consistent with a permanent
approach to moral thinking; but I do not think my writing would be
palatable to everyone. Instead, I think a number of people with
additional information, and actually the entire truthful literature of
all civilizations should provide the support people need.</p>
<p>It is hard for a single collection of works, or a single work, to
support everyone’s needs, which are quite diverse, apart from the
diversity of their backgrounds and natural constitutions. Is should be
much easier for the literature of the earth to satisfy all the other
needs, given there is a way for people to find useful information, that
is truthful, reliable, and more relatable to their experience.</p>

With Non-holism. A Star. Part I.</a></h2>
<p>What would it take to conceive of and understand everything that
exists? On reflection on our own experience, considering our fellow
animal companions, and the tools and robots that combine them, exploring
off-earth locations, and ourselves, we can see quickly that there is no
singular tool or sensor we can rely on for complete information, on
almost anything. When we want one piece of information about something,
we might use our eyes, while another animal might use sound; using
equipment, we might rely on a camera, or a thermometer. The starting
point for understanding an object is having some way to gather
information, and working up from very basic sensors and measuring
devices, to computers, to computers combining devices, we find ourselves
with ever increasing complex heterogeneous systems. And we must notice
that we, too, are complex systems built of subsystems specialized on
special tasks, and wherever that involves gathering information about
the world using a specific approach, or reflecting using a related
approach, we are talking about a component or module, or specialized
system, or organ, that is not itself intended to understand the whole of
any object whatsoever.</p>
<p>To my mind, at the moment, the only way I would be satisfied that I
could completely understand any particular object, like a planet, say
Earth, would be to be have a complete copy of that planet in my mind, or
be able to conceive of the whole at once without any need to rotate, or
change levels of fidelity; but maybe I wouldn’t be quite content with
that, as I think about it now, not having the actual thing, relying on a
mental simulation or representation, and so instead, I would want to
have a copy of the exact thing, and an understanding of replication of
the thing, testing the new thing for comparison against the original,
and probably an understanding of all natural patterns that act on or
influence that thing, which would be invisible to someone, who can say,
see only an image of the accurate globe, but not how things behave
completely.</p>
<p>These considerations exclude what is going on in the rest of the
universe influencing the motion of the object, it’s location (where is
it?), and so on and so forth, and so it is clear, that to understand the
object entirely, one has to understand more about the system, and how
much more is required is unclear. Is one finished when one completely
understands the universes, or does one need to know the position of the
universes relative to something else, or in the context of something
else? It’s my view that still we would not know where we are, even if we
understood where we are in relation to the rest of the universe, with
seemingly complete information about the universe, if we have no
understanding, or open questions about what else there might be.
Instead, all we could do is content ourselves, with the seeming
completeness and consistency within the system, if it existed in such a
way that there is no peering out of it.</p>
<p>What it would mean to have complete knowledge is not the topic of
this brief article however, although it is an important point to state
“You will not have complete knowledge” in a way that is final, before
moving on to how we might cope with that fact. I think this is a topic
that can be put to rest.</p>
<p>Another related thought, which will make this clear, involves an idea
I had, which I called “Mattanaw’s law”, mocking in part the need to
append an egoistic name to each andevery singular discovery, which is
hardly an honor, when one has thousands of ideas, for I would not want
to be remembered for one idea only, although to be remembered for one
idea, for a few hundred years, is better than to be deleted instantly on
death, than a short while later.</p>
<p>Mattanaw’s law is simply this. Any unit of storage has to have a
configuration that is greater in complexity, or has more potential
information, than what it is actually storing. Using this law we can
quickly see, that one could not ever acheive even basic
self-understanding. The main point, is that one’s brain could not fully
understand one’s brain,even in an isolated context not taking into
consideration the remainder of the universe. More than this, one’s brain
could not understand one’s brain AND the rest of the body, because of
course, if the storage cannot completely represent itself, it cannot
represent all else related that has nothing to do with the storage. And
it may be that the total body includes more potential information than
even the brain and mind, simply by the quanity of mass and complexity of
the other organ systems.</p>
<p>So on two points it is impossible to have complete and holistic
information about ourselves and the world around us, and I believe this
is irrefutable, to the extent that we acan move on from this, and begin
to discuss coping. It is clear that we all have the difficult issue to
deal with of having multiple seemingly different identities, stemming
from thinking in different contexts with different emotions, foci of
conversation, and so on and so forth. Feeling drawn from one desire, one
emotion, and one thought to the next, we never attain that feeling of
complete synthesis that we really want that would bring it all together
into complete clarity. Instead, it appears we have, and we are fortunate
for it, occasional insights and experiences that do put some of the
pieces together that we have moments of ecstatic understanding. Even
these moments are incomplete, and are transitory, and an understanding
of why precedes an approach for dealing with discomforts that
result.</p>
<p>We covered why this is necessary, to an extent. I will continue on
this point, and then move onto how we can deal with it in the next
part.</p>

<h2 id="sawing-bicycles-in-two"><a name="sawing-bicycles-in-twe">Sawing
Bicycles in Two</a></h2>
<p>For a while I’ve been considering purchasing a bicycle that would
fold for travel, but have been very annoyed at the price of the
bicycles, the non-standard sizing of folding bikes, and the difficulty
of purchasing and having them shipped.</p>
<p>Instead of buying a folding bike online, it is much easier,
efficient, and inexpensive, to simply buy a bicycle at Target or
Walmart, that is more standardized for less than $250.</p>
<p>At least then the bicycle appears similar to a normal bicycle and has
parts that can be expected to match parts that are available elsewhere,
for replacing tires and brakes and so forth.</p>
<p>But there is the limitation that these bicycles are <em>not</em> easy
to transport. I’ve taken a bicycle on a plane, and I concluded it is not
worthwhile.</p>
<p>So at this moment, I’m wondering:</p>
<p>“Why don’t I just saw a bike in two pieces and hinge it?</p>
<p>Or</p>
<p>“Why don’t I drill holes in the frame, confirm that I can shove bolts
through, and affix braces, and then cut it in half?”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Some might say this is a risky activity, but I think probably</p>
<p>it is easy and nearly risk free.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>So I’m going to buy a bike and saw it in half.</p>
<p>Maybe I’ll even saw it into three chunks.</p>
<p>Want to see a bike in three chunks?</p>

<p>A recent interesting occurrence where I’m living is the eruption of
Kilauea, the world’s largest active volcano. Below is a video showing
the current growth of a pool of lava in a caldera, near a location where
lava is spewing out like a fountainhead.</p>
<p>Watching these videos, you can see there are patterns emerging even
with simple pooling and cooling of lava, near the surface.</p>
<p>What do you think about the pattern that patterns will emerge such as
this?</p>

<p>In the sciences we are apt to notice patterns such as this and then

diversity to continue?</a></h2>
<p>[Aside: This post includes responses to questions about an implied
preference of light over darkness, and a point of view that assumes that
love is desirable, above all other traits, versus other traits, that we
certainly have but don’t think necessary or desirable all of the time.
The below perspective assumes that diverse traits were required to get
us into the position of dominance as a species that we are now in (not
that dominance is desirable, but is speaks to the survivability of those
traits), and what to do in the future given these traits. There is some
missing conversation, and I am indebted to the promptings of other
questioners/users in my group, who I cannot necessarily name here, for
not enough familiarity.]</p>
<p>I’m not sure. It’s attractive to want to think “darkness” is more
than a metaphor, and I see Ego as magnetic as well, perhaps more than
affection. If we look at species like Chimpanzees, we can see that love
is not magnetic, except in group subsets, and only temporarily. I think
the same is true with humans, even among those who claim to place love
at the highest.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>I think Humans, true, exhibit different behavior than Chimpanzees,
but I do think if we look at anthropology without bias, we would find
that there are trends towards enjoying dominance, particularly of strong
males. Strength and proof of acquisition seems to be very important to
humans and it is important to Chimpanzees too. This is why we are
likened to Chimpanzees versus Bonobos– animals that show different, more
egalitarian, loving patterns. Yet loving/affectionate patterns exist in
Chimpanzees too.</p>
<p>There could be some trajectory for preferring love/affection in
evolution, but there is the issue of self-protection from competitors
that causes issues, and in any event, the anthropology/zoology of our
history should be employed to inductively infer what is next for us,
even apart from any genetic analysis.</p>
<p>What is even more troubling for those who might prefer some
particular religious viewpoints, over others, is that it may not ever be
beneficial to prefer any particular trait over others, including love,
if the consequence is deleterious, given certain conditions. So I don’t
know is the answer, bec we need to support diversity in order to get all
we need collectively. A better question might be “What should that
diversity consist of, and can we remove any certain undesirable traits”
and in that case, I think we have to support Eugenics again. And that
actually is my position, that we need to eventualy plan our species.</p>

comparisons.</a></h2>
<p>[Aside: A friend, Iakovos Koukas, respected in HighIQ Societies,
posted concerning the preference for love versus egotism, and this was
my response. My response in no way was intended to be excessively
critical of his intent in his post, which was not supposed to be really
detailed and analytical, yet I think it is worthwhile to share here,
what I think is a common error about how we “choose” between
dispositions and behaviors, in a way that is less scientific, and more
received/traditional/inherited than we might think.]</p>
<p>Russell was asked what his final message might be on video, and in
all his sophistication, and vast publications, still chose “Love is wise
and hate is foolish” or something similar. I think your view is in
keeping with his, and might be a sensible message to the world, knowing
that the world cannot read the rest of Russell’s works.</p>
<p>But when one looks at it closely, I think the reality is much more
complex than this dichotomy, which is based on linguistic analysis, and
not psychological or zoological data gathering. The reality would be
more elegant, and I think skewed towards the ego, since we have to
convince ourselves of love, but we don’t have to convince ourselves,
that acquisition is necessary, or that emulation of others who could
achieve such acquisitions is desirable. But at the same time, I don’t
accept the ego so much. It’s just old nomenclature for self-preference,
and is directly at odds with “Your body is a temple,” and other ideas
about beliefs of the paramount importance of the self, which I don’t
agree with either– however, I think “My mind is a temple” is better as a
heuristic than say “Forget your mind and treat the minds of others as
temples.”</p>

Influence and “What to learn next”</a></h2>
<p>Is anyone here aware of any tool that is able to measure the
influence of a particular author or the work of an author on the total
published documents available in a range of languages?</p>
<p>I recall hearing, not long ago, that a particular author was the most
cited, but now I question that information, and think instead it was not
based on actual data. Having no available method for surveying all
textual information, and having no clear methodology for extracting
references when they are not clear citations, or bibliography entries, I
don’t think it is even possible currently.</p>
<p>If there isn’t a place to search for all available textual
information, I question the ability of any tool to consume such
information, and output a result about how often any author was
referenced. Anyone who searches in Journals or Legal repositories knows
that much information is sectioned off, for the purpose of ensuring
profitability.</p>
<p>This question arose as I was wondering which play of Euripides to
start my audiobook journey with. I purchased an iWatch and would like to
be able to listen to audiobooks while doing all sorts of activities. The
question came up though, which everyone faces, about what exactly to
read. What is of interest and value? Already knowing I wanted to read
Euripides, I still want to be able to determine the relative value of
the work, without relying on hearsay, using some quantitative
method.</p>
<p>I’m not certain how to separate popular works from works of high
value, other than using my own judgement, after reading the
documents.</p>

<h2
id="skepticism-is-not-a-strategy."><a name="skepticism-is-not-a-strategy">“Skepticism”
is not a strategy.</a></h2>
<p><em>[Written in a free moment, edits may be forthcoming]</em></p>
<p>Skepticism, to be clear, has always been extremely important to me.
Skepticism, which might be characterized as a willingness to question
almost anything that one finds to have some defect, is a key concept
within the field of philosophy, and its continual resistance against
various forms of objectionable dogma. I consider myself a Philosopher
before anything else, and one might say that Philosophy is my Religion,
taking religion to have a meaning that does not require any superstition
or afterlife. Since skepticism is a concept that is key to philosophy,
and I’m by nature a problem finder and solver, it is very important to
me, to have the freedom to question any point of view that seems to have
errors, regardless of the popularity of related opinions.</p>
<p>Nearly every philosopher that is well known historically has been a
skeptic to a degree, although the most famous exemplar is most
definitely Socrates, as portrayed by Plato. Skepticism in Philosophy is
a tradition is well over 2400 years old.</p>
<p>However, as of late, I’ve become opposed to terms that are thrown
about as if they are, in themselves, strategies. Oftentimes, the
meanings they are immediately associated with, their
denotations/connotations, are mistaken for what might be considered as
well-developed methodologies for dealing with various situations that we
find ourselves in. I have to admit, I have the feeling that “Skepticism”
has a certain vagueness, that leads me to admit, on close inspection,
that there is no clear methodology represented by it. Earlier, I made
the comment “What is the form of your strategy” which meant “I think
your perspective is not well developed and is mostly mental.”
Strategies, policies, and procedures, are only such, in my estimation,
once they’ve been clearly explicated. Otherwise, we find people say they
have strategies when they have none. Very notably, politicians will say
this: i.e. “We have a plan…” When one inquires if one can read the plan,
one finds that the plan is actually mental, in that it has not been
recorded into a tangible format, and actually is quite vague. In my
experience, whenever this is the case, one can expect a failure to
record the strategy. Because strategies, policies, and procedures, are
developed creatively, as they are recorded, and as edits and revisions
are made iteratively.</p>
<p>For those who live in the software industry: Can you imagine if
someone said they had a complex program in their head, but that they did
not yet record it? Naturally, the software architect and engineer, and
anyone else involved in software, would recognize that such a program
would not be readily recorded without changes, and the usual case is,
that it cannot be recorded, because it is vague, incomplete, or would
not work.</p>
<p>I can assure you that there is no Philosopher that has a program of
<em>Skepticism</em> ready to be written into code, or that they could
even describe a complete Skeptical process or approach in a narrative
format, in a way that is totally usable in real life, or would be agreed
upon by other parties.</p>
<p>One might contend that the entirety of philosophy constitutes, to
some extent, a method of skepticism, but I have to confess that I don’t
think this is the case, as there is no clearly defined <em>method of
skepticism</em> in Philosophy or class of methods that are well known,
or agreed upon, by any Philosophers, and in my opinion, most take it to
mean something rather obtuse, on close inspection “Question
everything”.</p>
<p>Interestingly, this is at the base of Philosophy <em>and</em>
Science, and yet it is not really as strategy. It is mostly a readiness
to question.</p>
<p>However, I find the trends in Science to be somewhat opposed even to
this inclination, even though it is supposed to lie at its root, in that
people will try to enforce a supposed scientific authorities viewpoint
on everyone, without exception, without listening to interesting or
novel dissenting opinions.</p>
<p>A current example is the case of people who are questioning the
current policy with respect to COVID-19, which in my estimation, is not
a strategy, but a quick ad-hoc reaction to provide some “answer” that
would be quickly adopted, without much change to how we were already
living. In other words “social distancing” to me, is not a strategy, or
is a strategy of the most minimal variety. An incipient strategy, or
more precisely “A way to hide from working out a strategy”.</p>
<p>I’m afraid, this must necessarily apply to a massive number of other
words that are really poses for strategies and approaches, that are
either not well developed, purely mental, or not recorded in a way that
anyone can agree upon, or point to it as a common reference.</p>
<p>Genuinely, I have now devalued even “skepticism” which lies at the
core of philosophy, for its failure to be a strategy. It is simply
propped up to be something more than it is. I will admit that I find it
important to use my mind to question whatever I like, and that I will
not limit myself and allow myself to be limited by others in what I’m
allowed to think about, criticize, or solve. If I find problems in
something cherished, that does not mean they are not still problems,
because people find something valuable in it. But what I’m doing isn’t
really skepticism in my opinion, and I’m not sure, precisely what
Skepticism is, strategically.</p>
<p>Let’s put it this way. Many people may consider themselves Skeptics.
But few of them have written anything down. For them, it is mental, and
probably vague. Others have written it down, over time, throughout
history, but none agree on what it is precisely, and none have limited
the class of methods that might comprise Skepticism, more completely
developed. And finally, Skepticism is probably mathematical, and
probably could be developed as far as one would like, for a huge number
of situations, perhaps with implications, that certain methods that are
found to be desirable mathematically, are not actually skeptical, as
originally conceived. I, for example, also reject “Open mindedness”,
which is related to Skepticism, because some things are well understood,
and it is better to move on, and gain more knowledge, by closing off
such avenues of thought. This to my mind, defeats some views of
Skepticism. Except they have not been defined as clear strategies…</p>
<p>An interesting problem I don’t think humanity has adequately
considered is:</p>
<p>What exactly is a strategy, and what is a minimal strategy, versus a
mature and well developed one?</p>
<p>When is a strategy “ready” for certain situations? When is it
done?</p>
<p>After determining the above, what status can we say “Skepticism” has?
I think at most, we can call it a <em>proto strategy</em>, meaning, it
has some insight in mind, and some methodologies attached, but is vague
and not clearly defined, however historically important it has
become.</p>
<p>Strategies that have these characteristics, to my mind, are “non
strategies”, becasue even the most thoughtless rememberer of the term
can pretend to have a method, when all they have is a word with no clue
how to use it. That is quite different, than being able to point out an
extremely extensively recorded methodology that seems to have some
validity with respect to optimization and applicability to real
situations.</p>

<h2 id="woah-hes-scrumpty."><a name="woah-hes-scrumpty">“Woah, he’s
Scrumpty.”</a></h2>
<p>For around six months I’ve been referring to women I find attractive
as “Scrumptys”. They are “<a
href="mattanaws-wordly-coinages.html#scrumpty-scrumptious">Scrumptyous</a>”.</p>
<p>The word comes from the English, “scrumptious” which is here
pronounced “scrumptyous” and is purely about the deliciousness of other
human beings. Not in a cannibalistic sense, but in the other sense of
the word “delicious”. Although “Scrumptious” still pertains to human
flesh in a number of ways you are probably very familiar with.</p>
<p>You can make fun and humorous use of this regularly as you think to
yourself about how attractive another life form seems to be. It does not
need to be used only for human beings, although I constrain myself
naturally in my application of the word. The more completely <a
href="mattanaws-wordly-coinages.html#miscellaneoused">miscellaneoused</a>
may have other ways of applying the word, and I would not want to reduce
their natural tendencies in any way.</p>
<p>Even better, to improve quality of life here upon the Earth’s crust,
we can refer even to those we are not attracted to, who remain
attractive to us nevertheless, insofar as we are admirers of them. Let
me explain.</p>
<p>You are a heterosexual man. You see another very attractive man at
the gym. In this case, think to yourself: “Wow, he’s a Scrumpty.”</p>
<p>Similarly, if you are a heterosexual woman, and you spot a beautiful
woman at the mall, you should think of her as a Scrumptyous human being
too: “Jessica, check that one out. She’s a Scrumpty like you!”</p>
<p>What is the purpose of such an activity?</p>
<p>You can begin to open yourself and everyone else to their true
feelings about the attractiveness of others, in such a way that it
reveals to everyone that everyone can find anyone else attractive. Even
if that doesn’t lead to additional levels of perceived sexual
attractiveness, or additional arousal.</p>
<p>What does this do? It will make the cognitive aspects of
attractiveness more clear. Thus homosexuals will come to seem like
heterosexuals, and the overlaps between the two will become more
apparent, and greater clarity will be established, about the cognitive
levels of sexuality, that are quite separate from, physical gender and
chromosomal and organ-related sexuality typing.</p>
<p>I’ve felt this way since I was a teenager about classification of
human sexuality, but only now did I become so fortunate, as to coin the
word Scrumpty.</p>
<p>So I’m going to start thinking of good looking Alaskan Men, here in
my home towns of Wasilla and Anchorage, as “Scrumptys”, and not only the
women.</p>
<p>So if I look at you in public, just think to yourself:</p>
<p>“I wonder if Matt thinks I’m a Scrumpty?”</p>

4 years in business for myself.</a></h2>
<p>For those who might not know, I was a Software Architect for a while,
and later a Consultant in Software Sales for big companies.</p>
<p>More recently I decided to use my expertise more generally, and try
to find ways to gain customers who would benefit from my ingenuity,
apart from anyone else’s branding.</p>
<p>I’m celebrating my 4<sup>th</sup> year in business. Who would have
thought? I’m building something for myself, and it’s been long enough
now that I can announce it with certainty, that it’s been a success. I
have my own brand and my own approach to offer. I have the required 3
years of financial reports, and more.</p>
<p>Not many know it takes about 3 years to really establish credibility
in business, and now I have another year to add to that.</p>
<p>The longest job I ever had is my work for myself; longer than all the
time I spent in High School.</p>
<p>High School felt long didn’t it?</p>
<p>Maybe some have had jobs lasting longer than 4 years. But I didn’t. I
always felt the need to move on, to advance and so on. But now there
isn’t really any desire to advance, at least not in the same way.</p>
<p>There was some “feast and famine”, but mostly feast fortunately! I’m
lucky to have amazing customers, especially during Coronavirus and I
recognize that. While others were and are facing some adversity, I
somehow made a turn around and obtained new business.</p>
<p>Last year was tough for me. So it isn’t totally uncalled for to have
a reversal of circumstances at this time. Circumstances are good. I’m
forced to be at home like everyone else, and forced to focus, rather
than spend time out and about.</p>
<p>I wonder how many people are happy to be redirected to focus
attention to home life.</p>
<p>“I used to shop, and work at the office, and ignore my family and
personal well-being…” and so forth.</p>
<p>I rarely celebrate anything and was thinking at least I should
celebrate having a successful operation. 4 years as of May
16<sup>th</sup>!</p>
<p>Wahoo!</p>

Deaths Were Not “Deserved”</a></h2>
<p>It is important to note, that whoever happens to die during this
pandemic, apparently wasn’t in the “remnant”.</p>
<p>I hope this allows us to finally acknowledge that nature will decide
who lives and who dies, and that no group is responsible for the deaths
of another group, and that no death is a result of any karmic process,
involving past mistakes made.</p>
<p>So if you are affected by Coronavirus, directly or indirectly, I hope
you are not troubled by anyone’s claims that it was due to anything done
previously by anyone.</p>
<p>Nature does what it does.</p>
<p>You are not to blame. No one else is to blame.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Why do I post this?</p>
<p>There are still many people who say that people who die, en-masse,
deserve it for some reason.</p>
<p>I.e. if you died in WWII, and you were of high quality, you are
diminished by some who will insist you “must have done something wrong
to deserve it.”</p>
<p>Believing that some “deserve it” in such a way that it is built into
nature is embarrassing.</p>
<p>Gays didn’t do it.</p>
<p>LGBTQ+ people didn’t invite it.</p>
<p>People who die are not being punished for “sins”.</p>
<p>Karma is ridiculous and needs to die.</p>
<p>The idea that plagues are invoked by groups of people some find
“undesirable” is even more foolish.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>I really hope that we can get passed this style of thinking.</p>
<p>But I also think that people who have subscribed to this type of
thinking in the past,</p>

is not a strategy, II.</a></h2>
<p>You said on your bumper sticker,</p>
<p>that all the religions can coexist.</p>
<p>Your entire strategy was in one word,</p>
<p>indicating it was not a strategy,</p>
<p>but nevermind that.</p>
<p>For now</p>
<p>Just notice that your COEXIST does not include the afterlife.</p>
<p>If you are a Christian,</p>
<p>the COEXISTENCE is on earth,</p>
<p>and everyone but your “remnant”</p>
<p>will go to hell.</p>
<p>And the other way around for you, from the perspective of the other
religions…</p>
<p>So do you understand that COEXIST</p>
<p>has no plan at all for eternity?</p>
<p>In fact, the people who state as much, probably chose an exclusive
heaven.</p>
<p>“This heaven is mine.”</p>
<p>COEXIST?</p>
<p>Then there’s this point:</p>
<p>Who cares about coexistence when what matters is eternity?</p>
<p>Life is short.</p>
<p>Eternity is forever.</p>
<p>Isn’t it better to die to get into heaven</p>
<p>than to adopt “COEXIST”?</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Let’s admit that COEXIST is not a strategy.</p>
<p>The truth is naturalism.</p>
<p>The answer is in a new revelation,</p>
<p>that of Mattanaw, for example,</p>
<p>that insists that nature will do</p>
<p>whatever it does…</p>
<p>And coexistence is established by nature,</p>
<p>and not your bumper sticker.</p>
<p>Nature has no provisions for your afterlife.</p>
<p>So a sound strategy,</p>
<p>eliminates any religion placing hopes in an afterlife,</p>
<p>and instead insists that this life is the one worth living,</p>
<p>IF</p>
<p>it can be made worth living.</p>

<p>Now that the pandemic has altered all life on earth, I’ve been
reluctantly thinking about the uninteresting topic of hygiene.</p>
<p>We’re supposed to already have good hygiene, and it’s questionable to
what extent more hygiene will prevent transmission.</p>
<p>Nevertheless we are expected to have sanitizers at home.</p>
<p>I’m single and am living independently, so there’s no one to infect
but myself, and if I have it, I probably will have it.</p>
<p>Nevertheless I’m coming up with some ideas.</p>
<p>The store was completely out of sanitizers. Since they were all out,
I went to the liquor store and bought some grain alcohol at 151 proof,
which has a high enough percentage of alcohol to be an antiviral and
antiseptic. First my brother asked if I could send sanitizers to him,
but he ended up finding grain alcohol himself, and so I kept what I
bought for my own use.</p>
<p>Recently, thinking about this alcohol, I thought “Why couldn’t I just
pour this in a vessel and use it to disinfect my hands without ever
pouring it out? Would this work?”</p>
<p>What are some factors that might make it not work? Here are some that
came to mind:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Unless you can get the alcohol off your hands and back into the
vessel, it will run out.</li>
<li>It may evaporate gradually (although you can seal it).</li>
<li>You would introduce substances into the alcohol, perhaps changing
the overall concentration, of affecting it in other ways.</li>
<li>Gradual deterioration or change of the alcohol due to the air
surrounding it, or other chemical reactions.</li>
</ol>
<p>My inclination though, is to think that you can actually use it any
number of times, except for the limitation created by number one above,
and maybe the number 4, although I think that’s unlikely.</p>
<p>I would expect that the alcohol would stay unchanged for a very long
period of time, perhaps indefinitely. After all, you can leave it in a
bottle and it will not change. One could circulate the alcohol from the
bottle, into a container, and back into a bottle again.</p>
<p>So potentially one could actually just use the same alcohol forever
perhaps, especially if it gets filtered and cycled.</p>
<p>Maybe just having it in a vessel is not good enough but I think that
would work too.</p>
<p>I intend to test it out, even though I may be unable to measure any
results, other than to see how the liquid appears over time.</p>
<p>I will have to wash my hands before using the alcohol, and maybe
after as well (if the alcohol gets too dirty looking).</p>
<p>Maybe I can use the same alcohol the rest of my life, as long as I
can keep getting the alcohol back into the container (which is
unlikely), but with a large enough jug, and an understanding of the rate
of loss by evaporation off my hands, maybe I can figure out how much I
need, to never have to buy it again.</p>

<h2
id="be-careful-what-you-wish-for."><a name="be-careful-what-you-wish-for">“Be
careful what you wish for.”</a></h2>
<p>Is not useful.</p>
<p>Like most other phrases of guidance in our culture.</p>
<p>In my experience, it is mostly useful for people who wish to</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Sabotage other people’s efforts, or</li>
<li>Dissuade folks or diminish their energies in trying to realize their
goals, which also is somewhat like sabotage, or</li>
<li>Try to relieve themselves about their inabilities to realize
goals.</li>
</ol>
<p>“Be careful what you wish for” is used to mean:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>“You said you wanted X, so I’m going to make sure that X isn’t good
for you. Didn’t you know that X was going to involve me harming
you?”</li>
<li>“Don’t you know that what you are trying to achieve, isn’t
worthwhile? Don’t follow your goals.”</li>
<li>“The cons outweigh the benefits of your wishes.”</li>
<li>“I can’t reach my goals, but that’s OK, because not doing anything
results in better outcomes than realizing goals does.” (An obvious
rationalization).</li>
<li>“Just don’t change and things will be better for you.” (e.g “I can’t
change and I don’t want you to either”, or “I didn’t want you
to.”).</li>
</ol>
<p>Most often this phrase is simply not used in a useful manner,
although there is a useful interpretation. That interpretation is:</p>
<p>“You really should understand what it is you are seeking, and define
your goals very carefully, so you’re in control as much as you can be
regarding the outcome, which can be made very favorable if you do it
right.”</p>
<p>That is roughly equivalent to:</p>
<p>“Separate worthy goals from those that only appear worthy.”</p>
<p>Notice that in practice, people don’t use it that way.</p>
<p>In other words, they use it in a mostly useless and harmful way.</p>
<p>Really strong thinkers don’t think according to these silly phrases
and expressions.</p>
<p>More often, I think, they break them and find something more detailed
and precise.</p>
<p>Because “The devil is in the ignorance.”</p>
<p>And “The ignorant are more likely than the wise to be the
devils.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Aside: I don’t believe in devils…]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>…</p>
<p>Another issue with this phrase:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><em>It’s a recommendation about <strong>wishes</strong>.</em> Who
wishes for things? That is incredibly superstitious. Now, to make sense
of it, it would be translated to “Be careful what you plan for or work
towards.” A wish without any action is hardly something to worry about.
Because the wish won’t happen?… You might as well say: <strong>“Be
careful what you PRAY for.”</strong> This statement can only be sensible
if it is about how you choose to plan your life. Now, improbable things
happen too. But these are not the results of wishes…, but nature.</li>
</ol>
<p>…</p>
<p>It can be used as a threat, and as a recommendation, or as a way to
make results seem less desirable, or plans less rational.</p>
<p>I think it is rare that people use it as a useful recommendation,
from kind and supportive intentions.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>This phrase also relates to the common story about Genies, and their
granting of 3 wishes.</p>
<p>Of course, most think:</p>
<p>“I’d wish to get as many wishes as I want…”</p>
<p>Well, let’s go with tradition and assume you cannot do that.</p>
<p>Instead, you get three wishes.</p>
<p>In the fictional story, of course, each wish does not turn out as
desired, or hoped.</p>
<p>This is because the person who did the wishing</p>
<p>“Was not careful what they wished for.”</p>
<p>As a rule, the character who has the genie, wishes quickly, without
much reflection.</p>
<p>Their wish is comprised of a single sentence.</p>
<p>“I would like to become the richest woman in the world.”</p>
<p>And so when it is granted,</p>
<p>everything else was taken as a variable, to manipulate,</p>
<p>and the genie provides a life in which the woman is grotesque, hated,
and rich,</p>
<p>and perhaps has no means of spending the money in any favorable
way.</p>
<p>So by not being “careful”</p>
<p>we are to think,</p>
<p>she has not gotten what she really desired,</p>
<p>or that she does not know what she really desires to begin with.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>I would agree with this interpretation, if wishes were real.</p>
<p>And what I say below applies to prayers too.</p>
<p>Why? Because how careful are your prayers about others?</p>
<p>You want someone to have some gain, but you don’t define what that
will come along with?</p>
<p>That resembles the foolish and simplistic wish a person might make to
a genie.</p>
<p>But moving on.</p>
<p>Let’s say I meet a genie. I’m told I will be granted three
wishes.</p>
<p>My wish would include a highly complex request, somewhat like a legal
contract, covering all bases:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>My request would be no less than 100 pages long.</li>
<li>My request would create prohibitions about avenues for negative
possible futures.</li>
<li>My request would involve not suddenly appearing in the future, but
actually executing all the steps to realization in a real way
(otherwise, one would feel one did not merit the results or that
everything was magical and reality was false).</li>
<li>I would require for the result to be real according to the correct
interpretation of realness (maybe).</li>
<li>I would require that the genie interpret it with my mind for full
understanding.</li>
</ol>
<p>There would be many other considerations. But the key is, I would be
<em>careful</em> about how I select my future, and more importantly,</p>
<p>I would be <em>detailed</em>.</p>
<p>Because wisdom is in the details.</p>
<p>Note that if I’m as detailed as the future reality would be, I would
get what I want exactly.</p>
<p>Now, since I cannot be that detailed, I can only create some request
that included that <em>due dilligence</em> that would most likely result
in the reality that corresponds to my request, and not some addition to
it.</p>
<p>This way, I would not be surprised, as all the fictional people who
make requests from genies are.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Since the story is fictional, it is designed to support an author’s
erroneous ideas about reality.</p>
<p>it is possible to form a plan that is knowledgeable enough to have a
reasonable expectation as to what realization might entail.</p>
<p>Of course it cannot consider everything.</p>
<p>But guess what? Then the issue isn’t about the care in the
wishing,</p>
<p>but in the impossibility of knowing the future,</p>
<p>and the variation that life would add into the mix.</p>
<p>And in that case, again, it’s not about “being careful what to wish
for”, but</p>
<p>learning how to not be concerned about the results.</p>
<p>So that defeats the idea “Be careful what you wish for” because in
that case, all you can do is</p>
<p>plan the best you can. And if it doesn’t turn out as expected,</p>
<p>you simply realize “It was not up to me”</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>Nature was too complex,</p>
<p>and as I think “It was predetermined that I would not plan as well as
I could, because</p>
<p>I only have the mind of a man,</p>
<p>and my prior planning was not adequate enough</p>
<p>to lead to having the skills to make this plan good enough.”</p>
<p>In other words</p>
<p>“My history and mind made me not have omniscient planning
capabilities.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Notice something else about my method.</p>
<p>I said I would want the result to feel real.</p>
<p>Else I would feel like I’m living in a fantasy world.</p>
<p>If you wish to be “The greatest athlete who ever lived”</p>
<p>and your skills were magical, and did not seem to result from any
abilities at all,</p>
<p>or any practice,</p>
<p>then you would forever feel like you’re living in a video game.</p>
<p>So if you want what you wish,</p>
<p>to connect with your current reality,</p>
<p>it means that goal has to be <em>realizable</em> anyway.</p>
<p>Unless you wish to become someone else.</p>
<p>But notice that if you wish to become someone else,</p>
<p>then you wish to be removed from existence.</p>
<p>That’s like if I wished to become a brand new pro athlete.</p>
<p>If I did that, why did I not consider that:</p>
<p>The result would be that I would die and a new athlete would be
created who is not me?</p>
<p>Or, somehow my memories are inserted.</p>
<p>Is this something worth wishing for?</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>So really “Be careful what you wish for” amounts to:</p>
<p>Be selective about who you want to become, and try to take into
account all the outcomes, that can be reasonably known in advance.</p>
<p>For everything else, you will just find out,</p>
<p>like everyone else will find out in the course of their complex and
unpredictable lives.</p>
<p>And that’s another reason why the advice is worthless.</p>
<p>Because it can always be used against you,</p>
<p>because there will always be negatives</p>
<p>that you will not account for,</p>
<p>because that is simply a part of the complexity of life.</p>
<p>So you could have an amazing plan,</p>
<p>execute it,</p>
<p>get what you want,</p>
<p>and want what you get,</p>
<p>but people who wish to tear you down will say that anything that
negative that happens to you,</p>
<p>is due to your</p>
<p>Not being careful what you wished for.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>And that’s why this is not a useful phrase to live your life by.</p>

of Concern about Overpopulation.</a></h2>
<p>A friend in a social group on Facebook asked about why interest in
overpopulation has diminished over the years.</p>
<p>The following was my answer:</p>
<p>I’ve brought up “overpopulation” many times over the years despite
recognizing and sensing that people have developed a distaste for it. My
ongoing interest in it, is likely due to exposure to authors from the
1800s and early 1900s who did not yet have the biases that people have
today.</p>
<p>That it’s a fundamental issue is not really seriously up for debate.
People will procreate with no possessions or resources at all, totally
destitute, and in complete ignorance; and that is an example of
overpopulation on the micro scale. Starving babies that keep coming and
so on…</p>
<p>Here’s my list. People sense that overpopulation means:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Control over reproductive rights. “Rights” to reproduce.</li>
<li>Potential trend towards use for Genocide.</li>
<li>Ethnocentrism/Elitism since certain populations would be the ones
that would be considered overpopulating, in comparison with others.</li>
<li>Urban perspective. Urban people tend to not see the problem (They
have a different idea about what a good life consists of in relation to
nature, and may see nature as a tool, potentially, to expand an urban
lifestyle).</li>
<li>Eugenics is what is in the speakers mind (as has already been
mentioned in the thread). But there is nothing fundamentally wrong with
Eugenics and it is probably necessary to rid of some really bad traits
that we continue to pass along. (Some form of Happy Eugenics, for
readers who have prejudices about what eugenics entails).</li>
<li>“Spread forth and multiply” is being challenged. Spread forth and
multiply is an imperative, whatever the consequences.</li>
<li>Touching on a Taboo, something not PC. A couple other reasons:</li>
<li>Non-issue. Competing scientific conclusions. You mentioned at one
point 2 billion was the supposed maximum number. I encountered
literature at one point suggesting that 12 billion was a number that we
would approach as a limit, but that we would not cross that limit. This
led people, including many students, to believe, that population control
is a non issue. So I think several years’ worth of students seriously
disregard population control as something worth pursuing out of bias,
and belief that it is a settled topic. (no reason to think it over any
further)</li>
<li>Inability to discuss it intelligently (some weird barrier I have not
been able to identify. Maybe this is part of what your post is about. It
could be cognitive-dissonance due to existing commitments or prior
choices, or belief in legacy, etc…).</li>
</ol>
<p>…</p>
<p>When debating this topic with people outside this group, I get the
feeling that they don’t want to discuss it or seem uninterested. Either
it’s taboo for many, or they haven’t given it good consideration. There
could be other reasons but I notice people are very poor at discussing
this topic. 9 might give some reason for this.</p>
<p>I think this is a very good topic to point out, to reveal that people
are often not as serious about solving the world’s problems as they
claim they are.</p>
<p>I’m still interested in automating work so we can depopulate and live
lives of maximum quality, with more clean environments mostly
everywhere.</p>
<p>I had a nice stream that I used to play in when I was a kid, and as I
grew up, I noticed it go from somewhat clean to completely unusable.
It’s far too polluted now. So naturally, people are deterred from using
it, and from valuing it… but that is only because of their reaction to
its current state. If they were exposed to it as I was, they would value
it.</p>
<p>It reminds me of the end of the movie <em>Soylent Green</em> with
that one gentleman who wanted to die after watching a video on how earth
used to be, and how Charlton Heston’s character only then realized what
he should have been valuing all along.</p>

<h2
id="mood-of-a-conversation-and-narrow-mindedness."><a name="mood-of-a-conversation-and-narrow-mindedness">Mood
of a Conversation and Narrow Mindedness.</a></h2>
<p>Some people seem to have horrors and hard lessons ready at hand for
conversation, while others do not.</p>
<p>Horrors I’ve seen or learned about are easily recalled, and I’m ready
to add them whenever the addition is necessary or relevant.</p>
<p>Many others seem to want to “sweep certain topics under the rug”, so
to speak.</p>
<p>Many want to limit the number of premises that might be considered in
an argument, because they do not seem “optimistic” or “happy”, even if
they are applicable.</p>
<p>Yet certainly any important premises need to be included to be
certain the conclusion is a valuable one.</p>
<p>Some might not understand why I might bring into discussion topics
like brain trauma, the skinning of live animals, the self-burning and
immolation of Buddhists, and the genocides of Auschwitz, and others
recorded in the Bible, and elsewhere.</p>
<p>Of course these topics are not pleasant, but pleasantness is often
irrelevant.</p>
<p>For a very long time, I have found it really uncomfortable, that
others do no recall these things readily whenever they are applicable.
Whenever not recalling them, results in the wrong conclusions or
decisions.</p>
<p>It is irrational to not include such considerations whenever they are
relevant. Even if that would seemingly convert a “positive” conversation
to one that feels “negative”, to <em>some people</em>, but not all
people, in the conversation.</p>
<p>I don’t mean to be a <em>downer</em> (I’m not. If I am, it’s to a
few, temporarily), inserting macabre subjects into conversations where
some think they don’t belong. The issue is that these subjects do
belong, but that others are not willing to hear them, whenever they are
brought up.</p>
<p>The mood of the conversation sometimes dictates the social
appropriateness of the subjects to be discussed.</p>
<p>If people are more euphemistic, as with political PR, it would
indicate that narrow mind is being applied. Because listeners, and
questioners, will be limited to what is supposedly the most civil
discourse, only allowed to bring up topics that do not diminish a
certain civil propriety of the conversation.</p>
<p>“We don’t need or want to discuss <em>that</em> right now”.</p>
<p>Sometimes the mood of a conversation, it seems, determines, in
advance, that an improper conclusion will result; that inferences will
be drawn from an incomplete set of premises; that narrow-minded thinking
will be preferred to exhaustive, broad <em>and</em> penetrating
thought.</p>
<p>Notice that the mood of the conversation does not determine the
requirements of proper analysis.</p>
<p>If someone is hired to solve a problem, it will be important that
they have all the information, and make all the correct relationships,
to find the right solution. It will be their job to make the correct
analyses.</p>
<p>Politicians don’t seem to communicate like these problems
solvers.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Let us consider one example.</p>
<p>One topic that is so often left out of conversation, but so often
relevant to it:</p>
<p>Brain Trauma.</p>
<p>Does the reader happen to understand, how many topics this relates
to?</p>
<p>Consider:</p>
<p>“I’ll remember you forever” is a false promise.</p>
<p>How many relationships does this impact?</p>
<p>Have you ever watched a video, or saw a photograph, of someone you
loved, only to wish you could feel them in person again? The video and
the image, are just “dead” artifacts, from a time when someone was
alive.</p>
<p>When enough time has passed, the images and videos surprise use,
because they include much that we could not recall any longer. “How did
I forget so much!?” one might lament, causing one to become sad at
having so little recorded.</p>
<p>But at the same time, the recordings are limited:</p>
<p>“I see the video, but I cannot feel (him or her)? I somewhat remember
how they feel, and smell, but that is all disappearing! I’m not sure I
can really feel it any longer!”</p>
<p>A book that did an excellent job of explaining this topic was C. S.
Lewis’s “A grief observed.”</p>
<p>In that book C.S. Lewis discusses the experience of losing his lover,
who was to become his wife. He was a Christian man, so it occurred to
him to consider why he did not have faith that he would see her again,
among other topics. Grief is unpredictable and highly individual. But
one thing I think is universal, is the feeling of loss of memory, and of
the ability to relive what was originally lived. That memory is a mere
copy, that dies over time.</p>
<p>We all experience memory loss and brain damage, as we die.</p>
<p>When we die, brain damage will be complete.</p>
<p>But some suffer more significant brain damage, and we cannot pretend
that it does not impact them the way that it impacts them…</p>
<p>This is not a complete treatment of the importance of Brain Trauma in
everyday life.</p>
<p>But I hope it is clear to the reader, that even minor brain trauma,
which might be called “everyday brain trauma” effects everyone, and is
of mortal and profound significance.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Let’s consider another.</p>
<p>That life has serious downs, and that these downs are often
random.</p>
<p>“Life is good” is false. It varies. Auschwitz. Slavery. Warfare.
“Life is good” is used when people seem to have temporarily disabled the
horrible things they know about from their conscious awareness.</p>
<p>It is not disrespectful to make these points. To bring these
extremely relevant but saddening points into conversations whenever they
offer something conclusive or definitive, or when they bring an analysis
to completion, is to be real.</p>
<p>What does it have to do with optimism? It’s about being smart and
having thorough knowledge.</p>
<p>If someone’s life is nothing but torture and pain, it is unfair to
conclude, without considering all fact, as if it were a foregone
conclusion, that “life is good” is truth.</p>
<p>“Step into my shoes and say life is good” is something that a few
billion people might tell you, if you were to <em>listen</em> to
them.</p>
<p>Or they might tell you that “life is good” out of a desire to
convince themselves too. This is something that happens. This is one
reason you cannot trust:</p>
<p>The Optimist.</p>
<p>Because the Optimists include people who are willing to 1) lie in
order to seem positive, or 2) try to explain to themselves why life is
worth living, despite their experiences.</p>
<p>Realism is the only perspective that may be used to analyze a topic
correctly, and it must take into consideration both optimistic and
pessimistic mindsets.</p>
<p>Many analyses are incomplete without these considerations. But we
keep analysing life as if these things are not relevant. Or we push them
from the picture, or from our awareness.</p>
<p>In my life, I’ve spent much time listening to what people say,
without completely expressing my feelings on topics because I thought
they would dishearten others, or would bring down moods of
conversations.</p>
<p>Too much gravity; too much depth.</p>
<p>From childhood, not only in adulthood.</p>
<p>“Nobody wants to hear this.”</p>
<p>Or, conversations would be changed, or disinterest encountered.</p>
<p>People change the subject, when it goes in a direction</p>
<p><em>they do not like</em></p>
<p>and that is hardly rational or realistic.</p>
<p>Or honest and truthful.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>One more. Let’s look at enlightenment and “self-actualization”.</p>
<p>So many messages are incomplete, if they do not include conversation
about the human brain, and about identity over time. We need to cover
the changes we will experience mentally due to trauma, sickness, or
other changes in health. We cover up important issues when teaching kids
because we will think we will scare them. But the truth is that we will
enable them and remove obstacles by teaching them with these relevant
facts often in view.</p>
<p>“Is it possible to achieve enlightenment?” Maybe. I think not. But
whatever that happens to be, don’t you think it is temporary, given the
nature of brain tissue?</p>
<p>When you attain enlightenment, or self-actualization, do you not
think that means that brain tissue will assume some configuration,
without which, you did not achieve it? And if so, do you not see the
impermanence, and fragility of this brain tissue?</p>
<p>Thus “salvation” could only be a temporary thing.</p>
<p>The idea that is sold to us, though, is that once you reach
“salvation” you are saved. But this makes no sense.</p>
<p>All enlightenment is lost as the relevant brain tissue is lost. All
salvation is lost, if the brain is broken or destroyed. No one is
“invincible”. Salvation, in any form it takes, is not invincible. Nobody
is unchanging. Your friend can easily become someone else. You will see
this as you age. People some would call saints can easily devolve to
horrible people through cancer, or brain tumor, or dementia, or other
neural deterioration.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Last one.</p>
<p>Final judgement. Are you good? Well, suppose you have a traumatic
brain injury and your personality is changed, for the worse. Which of
you gets judged? I don’t happen to believe in any “final judgment”, but
what I would say, is that there is no reason to prefer the “good”
version of someone in judgment. The implication of this, is that if you
actually change your personality to improve yourself, it does not
necessarily mean that “that you” is the one that is worth judgment. But
most of us think that if we reach some state somehow it is permanent, or
the only one that matters, or the only one worth judgement. We see the
same thing with “success.” Someone attains success, by getting an
amazing job, or having great accomplishments, but then their life takes
a different course, and they find themselves destitute or unhealthy. Are
they then unsuccessful in total? We know these are absurdities, simply
because we are unable to admit the fact that each of these things are
transitory, that our brains are altered over time, or that our
environments and</p>
<p>“I was born again” <em>includes an understanding of this topic</em>.
Whatever change you make, it must be complete. Or else, it is to admit
it is impermanent, and that there is no clean break between the horrible
you, and the new you.</p>
<p>But it is clear that there is no such thing as being “born
again”.</p>
<p>How convenient. When you change, you are totally new and fresh? I
think you carry with you, much that was you:</p>
<p>Otherwise I would not know who you are right now?</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Remembering horrors, and harsh truths, makes one reasonable and
realistic.</p>
<p>Allows one to see through poor arguments immediately.</p>
<p>Is often met with resistance, hostility, or even anger.</p>
<p>But I will try not to shy away from bringing sense to nonsensical
conversations.</p>
<p>Even if that means</p>
<p>the partial deaths of religions and sources of national pride.</p>
<p>Ever consider that culture,</p>
<p>including religion and national pride,</p>
<p>mostly consists of living brain tissue?</p>

<p>And saying “the height of (fill in the blank)”</p>

<p>It is the same error as that which invokes</p>
<p>“Bestest.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>E.g. “The height of stupidity is (fill in the blank)”</p>
<p>Most likely,</p>
<p>what you fill that blank in with will be false.</p>
<p>It won’t be the heigtiest of the stupid things.</p>
<p>Plus stupidity has no height,</p>
<p>so it can go in the dumb metaphor section too.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Aside: Well maybe I shouldn’t say “dumb”.</p>
<p>How rude of me.</p>
<p>I indicated earlier we should not say that word.</p>
<p>It’s worse than calling people “retards”.</p>
<p>Instead I should say,</p>
<p>it will go into the</p>
<p>“Metaphors with problematic visuals” section,</p>
<p>that I haven’t added yet.</p>
<p>The fact that it is so frequently spoken</p>
<p>does make one forget,</p>
<p>that there is a metaphor in there.</p>
<p>It’s baked into that idiom so well,</p>
<p>you might think it isn’t in there at all.</p>
<p>It’s like saying:</p>
<p>“It’s the pinnacle of stupidity”</p>
<p>As though there were a stupidity pyramid,</p>
<p>with this instance of stupid at the very top.</p>
<p>This is different from saying there is a spectrum,</p>
<p>and that this would fall on the far end of the spectrum,</p>
<p>from least to most stupid.</p>
<p>It’s adding a hierarchy into the mix.</p>
<p>Not only hierarchy, heights.</p>
<p>Vistas, pyramids, and so on come to mind.</p>
<p>This is not a good visual,</p>
<p>for “stupidity”.</p>
<p>Funny enough,</p>
<p>if you were to say</p>
<p>“It was the height of all mountain overlooks.”</p>
<p>it would make more sense,</p>
<p>but it would seem redundant and ridiculous.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>OK, long tangent.</p>
<p>Back to the point.</p>
<p>Skinning animals is very heartless.</p>
<p>So is substituting one reality for another.</p>
<p>Truth is usually less heartless in the long term.</p>
<p>“Oh, it was just fine that you skinned the animals alive.</p>
<p>Keep doing that.”</p>
<p>Saying that to make a trained animal-skinner,</p>
<p>who skinned many animals alive,</p>
<p>may make the animal skinner feel</p>
<p>better about herself.</p>
<p>But who does it make feel really really bad?</p>
<p>Your distant cousins.</p>
<p>Those little skinned guys.</p>
<p>Glistening and suffering.</p>
<p>Get the idea?</p>
<p>In this case, substituting the reality that animals feel pain</p>
<p>for a reality in which they do not,</p>
<p>is actually more harmful,</p>
<p>in terms of long term consequences,</p>
<p>than single acts of skinning animals alive.</p>
<p>Opt for truth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Aside: there is a better strategy than this</p>
<p>but <a href="#what-medium-does-your-strategy-take">strategy
building</a> is not easy.</p>
<p>Also, the animal skinning example is only one.</p>
<p>Going with a false reality is almost <em>always</em> (if not always)
going to have</p>
<p>ill long term consequences.</p>
<p>This should be justified mathematically,</p>
<p>or with a truly representative model,</p>
<p>but I’m not in a position to create that at present.</p>
<p>For now I think it is better to state that it does seem to be the

<p>A point missed in the previous post, is that it is sometimes very
hard to tell which you are doing.</p>
<p>Are you rationalizing,</p>
<p>or are you</p>
<p>irrationalizing?</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Just now, I was clouded as to whether or not I was doing one or the
other.</p>
<p>It requires powerful introspection,</p>
<p>since one has to track thoughts, motivations and intentions,</p>
<p>and rationalization can happen</p>
<p>intrapsychically</p>
<p>in a very short period of time,</p>
<p>while one is not thinking about this topic at all.</p>
<p>It takes one by surprise.</p>
<p>It’s like if someone asks you to repeat a sentence you said,</p>
<p>word-for-word,</p>
<p>20 sentences ago.</p>
<p>You can’t do it,</p>
<p>if you weren’t tracking.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>When someone thinks you are rationalizing,</p>
<p>this means,</p>
<p>you might not know if you are rationalizing or not.</p>
<p>“Mattanaw, you seem to be irrationalizing…”</p>
<p>The inclination is to say no,</p>
<p>but what about in the gray area…?</p>
<p>What about when you were not attending to your thoughts,</p>
<p>THAT closely.</p>
<p>Before I said there were two kinds of rationalizing.</p>
<p>Let’s just stop with that.</p>
<p>Let’s rename</p>
<p>“RATIONALIZING”</p>
<p>“IRRATIONALIZING.”</p>
<p>except when,</p>
<p>we know we are making it actually rational.</p>
<p>We might not always know.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>I’m sad to say,</p>
<p>I think this is paradoxical within our introspection.</p>
<p>I’m not sure we can ever perfectly know,</p>
<p>when we are doing one or the other,</p>
<p>when we are not tracking.</p>
<p>Usually, we are not tracking.</p>
<p>If your powers of introspection, memory about your mental states, and
what you say, and your emotions are weak,</p>
<p>you may seldom know.</p>

<h2 id="two-ways-to-rationalize"><a name="two-ways-to-rationalize">Two
Ways to Rationalize</a></h2>
<p>The first way, thought negatively upon, rightly so, is:</p>
<p>“I take something that is incorrect, and nonsensical, and fallacious,
and fallaciously make it appear as if it were rational.”</p>
<p>Goals of this method: to cover up. To disguise. To manipulate. To
make your goals seem reasonable, or worthwhile, or rational, when they
are actually irrational, founded in error, based on desires or emotions,
or otherwise unjustifiable.</p>
<p>More can be said about this because it shows up in many forms, but
for now I think this is adequate.</p>
<p>We know about rationalizing mistakes, and bad habits, and errors,
etc…</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>But there is another kind of rationalization.</p>
<p>It’s when you make a mistake, think an incorrect thought, or detect
an irrationality in yourself, and find a way to correct it, modify it,
or otherwise fix it to be actually in keeping with rationality.</p>
<p>Some people are more inclined to this form of rationalization than
the other.</p>
<p>People should be educated to move from the first kind to the second
kind.</p>
<p>Because the second kind results in</p>
<p>RATIONALITY.</p>
<p>While the first kind results in,</p>
<p>IRRATIONALITY.</p>
<p>“Rationalization” is a sad misnomer, in the first case.</p>
<p>There is taking something and making it appear rational, and then
there is starting from something and making something new that
<em>is</em> rational.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>In both cases, one has some idea of what rationality is actually
like.</p>
<p>One is concerned with the appearance,</p>
<p>and the other is concerned with the reality.</p>
<p>Be concerned with the reality.</p>
<p>Remember that there are two ways to rationalize.</p>

<p>The conferences got cancelled.</p>
<p>The excitement didn’t.</p>
<p>“Bring on the</p>

<p>Where are the people who are coughing blood,</p>
<p>who aren’t me?”</p>
<p>Surprisingly, most are not actually fearful of death.</p>
<p>“If I get coronavirus, I do.</p>
<p>If I get killed having a good time in combat—</p>
<p>sure I’ll take that too.”</p>
<p>Just look at how eager kids were,</p>

<p>It’s sad.</p>
<p>We put medals on the stupid.</p>
<p>They may be deserving, nevertheless.</p>
<p>Parents were like</p>
<p>“Sure, go to the trenches.</p>
<p>Jimmy’s a good boy.”</p>
<p>Many Americans were quite excited to kill some Japs and Nazis.</p>
<p>When they weren’t too busy,</p>
<p>killing black people.</p>
<p>(Most were not busy killing black people, I know.</p>
<p>But hey, many were.)</p>
<p>Don’t agree?</p>
<p>Have you watched any Quentin Tarantino movies lately?</p>
<p><em>Django Unchained?</em></p>
<p><em>Inglorious Basterds?</em></p>
<p>These movies did make <em>some</em> sense, right?</p>
<p>Did you like killing those Nazis vicariously,</p>
<p>when watching those movies?</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Son, I can’t go to war,</p>
<p>I’m too valuable to die,</p>
<p>but you,</p>
<p>you son,</p>
<p>go kill some for both of us,</p>
<p>I’ll be keeping the tally.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>That killing excitement was not limited to young people, though.</p>
<p>Elders have maybe a greater blood lust.</p>
<p>They are bored.</p>
<p>“I have no sensation in my legs.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Aside: Why would the elders be excited, you ask?</p>
<p>Oh. They aren’t any smarter.</p>
<p>This is why the young, wait for the elderly</p>
<p>to die so truth can win over</p>
<p>lies and falsity.</p>
<p>there are exceptions.</p>
<p>Exceptions help you</p>
<p>rationalize to honor whoever it is,</p>
<p>you think deserves honor.</p>
<p>“Oh, they didn’t have the blood lust,</p>
<p>and joy of deathly entertainment.”</p>
<p>“Except they did watch hangings back then,</p>
<p>with picnic baskets.”]</p>

<p>Usually, adults imitate youths.</p>
<p>Fashion is not old, it is new.</p>
<p>And the target of fashion are young people.</p>
<p>“I’ll wear those jeans.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I’ll watch that teen movie. Sounds great.”</p>
<p>“TikTok is cool,</p>
<p>how do I advertise,</p>
<p>awkwardly on TikTok?”</p>
<p>“I’m not sure what I’m doing here right now.”</p>
<p>said that old guy</p>
<p>and old lady</p>
<p>on TikTok.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>But when it comes to politics and war, youths imitate adults:</p>
<p>“How can I go kill me some Japs?”</p>
<p>“A-Rabs”</p>
<p>“Sand Niggers.”</p>
<p>Don’t pretend it didn’t happen.</p>
<p>I don’t know of any little kids,</p>
<p>running around saying “Sand Nigger.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>or just</p>
<p>“How can we buy all the Clorox from the store</p>
<p>without any need whatsoever.”</p>
<p>To combat an invisible “enemy”.</p>
<p>“Dang, how do I use this Clorox,</p>
<p>to disinfect <em>everything</em>?”</p>
<p>No one is scared.</p>
<p>They are excited like it’s Black Friday.</p>
<p>“My money,</p>
<p>it’s for this.”</p>
<p>“I’ll be the last to die,</p>
<p>and I’ll buy it all. No need</p>
<p>for anyone else to live.”</p>
<p>At a store today, a cashier said</p>
<p>“Everyone seems to be in a good mood today.”</p>
<p>I agreed.</p>
<p>It is to be expected.</p>
<p>People are usually happy,</p>
<p>when someone is killed in a traffic accident on the highway too.</p>
<p>When will this aspect of human nature vanish?</p>
<p>Good question.</p>
<p>Why did you just ask it?</p>
<p>You didn’t,</p>
<p>I did.</p>
<p>Nobody asks these questions.</p>
<p>Maybe this sad tendency,</p>
<p>will be engineered out of us.</p>
<p>Either by biological engineering,</p>
<p>or teaching.</p>

<p>Maybe those most inclined,</p>
<p>to enjoy this stuff,</p>
<p>don’t procreate.</p>
<p>I’m not sure.</p>
<p>Weirdos abound.</p>
<p>“They know not what they do.”</p>
<p>“I never said Sand Nigger.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>I recently visited the Walmart in Wasilla.</p>
<p>Not one case of the Coronavirus has been reported in Alaska.</p>
<p>At all.</p>
<p>And the strategy Alaska has taken on,</p>
<p>like everywhere else,</p>
<p>(Yup your state is dumb too.)</p>
<p>has been to buy all the supplies,</p>
<p>and <em>not</em> distribute them evenly.</p>
<p>A better way to put it is:</p>
<p>America has no strategy.</p>
<p>It’s all excitement.</p>
<p>“America is the greatest of all nations.”</p>
<p>This great planless nation.</p>
<p>With massive resources dedicated,</p>
<p>to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (more than 1
trillion USD).</p>
<p>Yet there is no process plan,</p>
<p>for a disaster scenario.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Aside: Would you like me to work on this. For this effort, I will
only charge,</p>
<p>1 billion dollars.</p>
<p>Selling point: The hoard couldn’t do it for 1 trillion.</p>
<p>Yes, I know there are good people in these orgs.</p>
<p>Disaster scenario planning is lacking, and that’s just truth.</p>
<p>But also it’s “I’m HHS but i have no way to</p>
<p>disseminate this information.</p>
<p>The emergency broadcast system has not yet been</p>
<p>activated for this virus.</p>
<p>Why not activate, and share the plan?</p>
<p>Because there is no plan]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Excitement about possible death,</p>
<p>in the community.</p>
<p>“When can death finally arrive?</p>
<p>I need this.”</p>
<p>“Oh, it won’t actually be me.”</p>
<p>People don’t believe that accidents</p>
<p>apply to them.</p>
<p>Everyone else dies.</p>
<p>“I have communion with a diety I read about,</p>
<p>everyone else will die,</p>
<p>because of the (name a supposedly evil group).”</p>
<p>“Ooops I’m infected.</p>

<p>Most people don’t understand arguments,</p>
<p>as found in the discipline of logic.</p>
<p>They don’t know what an “argument” is.</p>
<p>This can be easily demonstrated.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Aside: they think an argument, is a confrontation of sorts.</p>
<p>It is, but there is another, vastly more important</p>
<p>meaning of the same word.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a
href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-informal/#Arg">Argument
as defined in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</a>. Some may be
thrown off by the fact that this definition is in an encyclopedia of
Philosophy. But, that’s because they would also unlikely expect that
Logic is a branch of Philosophy. If you were to study logic in school,
it would be in the Philosophy department. Other logics are found in
other departments, but core logic, as part of the extension of
linguistics, is still in the department of Philosophy (i.e. Symbolic
Logic, Systems of Deduction, and other Formal Logics). So the Stanford
Encyclopedia of Philosophy is an appropriate source on Logic.</p>
<p><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentation_theory">Argumentation
Theory on Wikipedia</a>Wikipedia recognizes the interdisciplinary nature
of logic, since of course, logical argumentation applies to any
discipline relying on language whatsoever. But notice, that this
article, is still heavy on contributions from philosophers.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument">Argument, on
Wikipedia</a> Also heavy on contributions from Philosophy.</p>
<p>The most influential treatment in History has been that provided by
Aristotle, since his logic was dominant until the time of Gottlob Frege,
an early founder of modern logic, whose works appeared in the late
1800s. Aristotle’s work was dominant for two millennia until it was
improved upon and corrected. His work is still taught in the beginnings
of many courses on Symbolic Logic.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Aside: Aristotle was not Christian and he predated Christianity.</p>
<p>Yet his logic dominated and is largely accurate. He contributed
the</p>
<p>Syllogisic Logic. Christians attempted to fuse his work with
theirs.</p>
<p>A primary objective of Thomas Acquinas was to fuse the
rationality</p>
<p>of Aristotelianism with his religion (Catholicism), in order to
provide a more firm basis for Christianity.</p>
<p>This is the typical account.</p>
<p>Mattanaw likes to emphasize that Christianity is not as logical as
Philosophy,</p>
<p>and there is no dogma in Philosophy, where you are free to</p>
<p>question anything.</p>
<p>Christianity would depend on Philosophy to have any logic at all.</p>
<p>The same is true with all of the other disciplines. Science
included.</p>
<p>Aristotle was probably more logical than you are.</p>
<p>Most would be unable to read Aristotle because he is more
intelligent</p>
<p>than they are.</p>
<p>The character Jesus did not write anything,</p>
<p>and it is not clear that he was logical,</p>
<p>since his authors did not</p>
<p>fictionalize his character to deploy much structured reasoning.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>…</p>
<p>There is a serious consequence to this.</p>
<p>It’s that people have no idea what conclusiveness regarding a topic
consists of.</p>
<p>They don’t know when the logic of an argument,</p>
<p>has lead to the answers,</p>
<p>however tentative they might be.</p>
<p>Instead, they just think,</p>
<p>that their thought on the topic,</p>
<p>is in some way</p>
<p>“The most important thought”</p>
<p>that deserves the most attention,</p>
<p>or in the least, consideration.</p>
<p>When they hear the thoughts of others,</p>
<p>they do not appraise for the logical quality of their thoughts,</p>
<p>or the degree of completeness of their analyses.</p>
<p>“Sure, you wrote a program that simulates the</p>
<p>situation completely,</p>
<p>including outcomes,</p>
<p>and it even optimizes decision making…</p>
<p>but you haven’t heard my thought on it.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>This can be used strategically in politics.</p>
<p>Although I have never witnessed this approach myself.</p>
<p>This is the approach of:</p>
<p>Taking people’s thoughts on a topic, fitting those thoughts into a
total situational analyses, and showing back to the public, how their
thoughts actually fit into the scheme of things.</p>
<p>Most would be satisfied that they have been acknowledged.</p>
<p>Many would be disappointed, that their thought was not the conclusive
thought,</p>
<p>that determined the right perspective.</p>
<p>But at least they would likely see that that is the case, by:</p>
<ol type="A">
<li><p>by being shown the complexity of the total situation,
and</p></li>
<li><p>by seeing that their thought was placed properly in the
situation, even though their part was small.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>…</p>
<p>Some few would expect actually anticipate this result,</p>
<p>and may be totally happy about the outcome,</p>
<p>because they build on their own thoughts, such that they frequently
see how their analyses improve, and how their earlier thoughts were of
lesser quality than their later thoughts.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>All this assumes, however,</p>
<p>that the total situational analysis</p>
<p>turns out to be</p>
<p>done by someone who is skilled enough to do it really well.</p>
<p>Or some group,</p>
<p>skilled enough to complete the project truthfully.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>In the end,</p>
<p>the argument will be logical.</p>
<p>The analysis complexity will suit</p>
<p>the complexity of the real problem.</p>
<p>People will see that there is a match between the problem,</p>
<p>and the analyses.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>People’s political thoughts,</p>
<p>are really just thoughts.</p>
<p>“This is what seems important to me in this issue.”</p>
<p>and not anything conclusive.</p>
<p>Some will have more conclusive thoughts,</p>
<p>but it will be those who have conducted such an analysis,</p>
<p>or see the complexity.</p>
<p>these people are not often found.</p>
<p>And either way,</p>
<p>a full analyses,</p>
<p>conducted by one individual or</p>
<p>any number required,</p>
<p>would match closely,</p>
<p>with the person who did happen to have a complex enough</p>
<p>mental representation.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Everyone else just needs their view,</p>
<p>to enter into the total analyses somehow.</p>

<p>When someone says,</p>
<p>“And that’s the bottom line.”</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>“Period.”</p>
<p>when they are finished talking,</p>
<p>you can trust they are probably uttering something false.</p>
<p>When you hear it,</p>
<p>you actually have reason</p>
<p><em>to extend the conversation</em></p>
<p>nearly</p>
<p>every</p>
<p>single</p>
<p>time.</p>
<p>In fact,</p>
<p>trust the desire</p>
<p>to say something else,</p>
<p>like:</p>
<p>“Ahem, how did you logically arrive at the conclusion</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>what you said was the conclusion?”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Some conclusiveness warranting termination of thought,</p>
<p>consideration,</p>
<p>and additional analysis,</p>
<p>and information gathering,</p>
<p>has been <em>assumed</em>.</p>
<p>“Sir, can you tell me,</p>
<p>when the science is finished,</p>
<p>on this topic?”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Ma’am, can you tell me,</p>
<p>when I’m allowed to think about this one again?”</p>
<p>Or</p>
<p>“Ma’am, can you explain to me,</p>
<p>in detail,</p>
<p>under what circumstances,</p>
<p>I can finalize the conversation,</p>
<p>such that you will suspend thought</p>
<p>on a topic</p>
<p>like or unlike this one</p>
<p>too?”</p>
<p>^^ No one will have an answer to that last one.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>If you say these things,</p>
<p>forgive yourself.</p>
<p>Promptly self-correct.</p>
<p>Correct yourself when you notice the error,</p>
<p>if you notice it later,</p>
<p>and not immediately.</p>
<p>Practice until you notice it when it</p>
<p>hasn’t departed your head yet,</p>
<p>through your mouth.</p>
<p>Then at some point, you will not have to self-correct.</p>
<p>You just won’t say it.</p>
<p>Then you won’t think it.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Your thought may have been equivalent to:</p>
<p>“This was the most important consideration, to my mind.”</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>“This matters most.”</p>
<p>These are fair translations,</p>
<p>for some, but not all</p>
<p>instances of</p>
<p>“That’s the bottom line.”</p>
<p>But it’s still an error,</p>
<p>even on these more favorable,</p>
<p>less socially demanding</p>
<p>tyrannical interpretations.</p>
<p>But notice that’s the mistake of</p>
<p>“Bestest”</p>
<p>described earlier,</p>
<p>in the ThoughtStream,</p>
<p>“This is the bestest idea in this whole conversation.”</p>
<p>It could be true,</p>
<p>but it’s not the bestest idea in all conversations.</p>
<p>So it might not feel so final,</p>
<p>When McGenius the 3rd steps into the conversation,</p>
<p>and reveals to you,</p>
<p>like a revelation,</p>
<p>how mistaken you were.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Aside: McGenius the 3rd could be a woman, by the way.</p>
<p>It’s not a flattering name for a woman.</p>

<p>I was going to go to the Iditarod “re-start”,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Aside: The official start, versus the ceremonial start in
Anchorage],</p>
</blockquote>
<p>but missed it.</p>
<p>I only live about 15 miles away, so</p>
<p>I really should have made it.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>So today, I was thinking</p>
<p>“Dog sleds aren’t that cool anyway”,</p>
<p>compared to the newest thing out there:</p>
<p>Bird kiting.</p>
<p>I conceived of it,</p>
<p>but I suspect it already existed.</p>
<p>Because if it didn’t exist,</p>
<p>a more perfect world would include it.</p>
<p>But this world is the perfect world.</p>
<p>Therefore it existed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Aside: see the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontological_argument">ontological
argument</a> for the</p>
<p>existence of things that don’t exist.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>…</p>
<p>So how does bird kiting work?</p>
<p>You have a flock of bald eagles,</p>
<p>or geese,</p>
<p>or other trained birds.</p>
<p>They are tethered to a hang-glider like aircraft.</p>
<p>It’s much like a dog sled race,</p>
<p>but it utilizes bird power,</p>
<p>instead of doggy power.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Small helium balloons assist the lift</p>
<p>of the hang glider,</p>
<p>so the birds can still feel</p>
<p>free like</p>
<p>a bird</p>
<p>should feel.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>It takes some time to train the geese,</p>
<p>or the bald eagles,</p>
<p>or any other bird,</p>
<p>you find suitable.</p>
<p>Pigeons may work, but I’m not sure that’s been attempted,</p>
<p>or if any of this has been attempted.</p>
<p>I haven’t searched it on google or YouTube</p>
<p>yet.</p>
<p>But I’m sure you can do it,</p>
<p>if you put your mind to it.</p>
<p>Because you can do</p>
<p><em>anything</em></p>
<p>you put your mind to.</p>
<p>Right?</p>

<p>Well, not in these words exactly. But close.</p>
<p>And I agree. It’s sad.</p>
<p>It’s one of the <a
href="mattanaws-wordly-coinages.html#superpluralification">reasonss</a>
behind the existence of cults.</p>
<p>And cultiness. You know about cultiness right?</p>
<p>But I think mentors are important too (he does also I’m sure).</p>
<p>Here’s was my reaction:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>…in many respects I agree. But I make one important addition; an
exception, if you will: a well chosen mentor produces a concrete example
of what you could potentially become yourself.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Consider this. In athletics, people think it impossible to
achieve certain feats until they’ve seen it done by another person. Thus
a heroic athlete who did the impossible is quickly emulated, and
surpassed by those who choose him/her as a mentor. If not a mentor, we
can say that someone has created a goal that has now become realizable
in the concrete. This is a kind of leadership even if it may not provide
durable guidance in all the varieties of ways a person may provide
it.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>People avoid trying certain things, because of dangers, risks,
and seeming impossibilities. Examples of people who seemingly defy these
constraints are very helpful, and may not be lesser than the person who
strives to overcome those same constraints.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wrote about this before.</p>
<p>You should look for role models who seem to have similar traits to
you,</p>
<p>to see what is possible, given your characteristics.</p>
<p>You shouldn’t choose just one role model!</p>
<p>Maybe you don’t need to consider them role models at all.</p>
<p>Instead they are realistic examples of what is possible for you, if
you are more like them, and less like someone else.</p>
<p>People do this naturally to a degree, I think.</p>
<p>Just have a mentor for the right reasons.</p>
<p>The goal is <em>not</em> to pass the responsibility of thinking onto
the mentor.</p>
<p>Otherwise you are simply choosing a leader to follow.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>That can be OK too, but that is for another post.</p>

<h2
id="deciding-when-to-retain-knowledge."><a name="deciding-when-to-retain-knowledge">Deciding
When to Retain Knowledge.</a></h2>
<p>I’ve been advising large corporations on their technological
strategies for a long time now.</p>
<p>One thing that I find shocking, is the lack of appreciation for:</p>
<p>“You should decide X, because you will then have more critical
knowledge, that you can apply.”</p>
<p>Knowledge retention at large corporations is a massive problem.</p>
<p>“What does that have to do with me?” you might be thinking.</p>
<p>Well if large companies can’t retain knowledge,</p>
<p>what makes you think your information is being retained,</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>that you would ever find a strategy for retaining your knowledge?</p>
<p>This website is largely for this purpose, although what I
communicate, quite often, is goofy, or odd, or apparently unimportant or
even frivolous.</p>
<p>But I think most, would want to retain, even their twitter pages?
Right?</p>
<p>But saving critical information that is useful is more than just
being able to save twitter data.</p>
<p>Companies know this, because they are already aware of the importance
of talent. If the brains of their talent leave their organization, much
can be lost.</p>
<p>I’m not overly fond of naming significant names. But we can think
about Steve Jobs and the impact of his exit from Apple. And the impact
of his <em>return to Apple</em>!</p>
<p>Apple aside, companies continue to struggle with retaining knowledge
and it’s not always possible to retain a key employee.</p>
<p>Knowledge loss happens in four vital ways, as I see it at present,
without too much oversimplification:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Aside: There are more ways to organize this information. There may
be more or less categories based on how you choose to split it up, and
it’s partly arbitrary. I’m not fond of enumeration in this way, like “12
steps to life” etc… It conceals arbitrariness and appeals to people’s
fondness for particular round numbers, or familiar measures.]</p>
</blockquote>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>People are lost.</strong> The HR view that people are
replaceable results in permanent loss of critical knowledge.</li>
<li><strong>Documents are lost.</strong> There is an inability to retain
that knowledge, <em>even if</em> the knowledge was recorded
somehow.</li>
<li><strong>Knowledge Transfer limitations create loss.</strong> There
is an inability, to get that information from one person, or one
document, into another person. This is due to: 1) People simply cannot
use information the same way. KT doesn’t transform one person into
another. The total knowledge of one person, with the additional key
information, constitutes the information. 2) There is not enough time
and interest, often, to absorb what has been recorded (documentation
often goes completely unused).</li>
<li><strong>Application Knowledge is lost.</strong> Finally, even if
people were retained long enough for KT, and documents were created, and
people were educated, there would be failure to apply. And this is
connected, again, to talent, in 1.</li>
</ol>
<p>From this it should be apparent that knowledge retention is related
to talent retention.</p>
<p>But people don’t go much further than this. We can still strategized
effectively upon this information.</p>
<p>Long before getting to this point, however, companies seem to be
lost, and give up.</p>
<p>They don’t even get to the point of admitting:</p>
<p>“I’m OK with losing this vital knowledge.”</p>
<p>The people, and the knowledge are both lost.</p>
<p>People seem not to even notice, somehow.</p>
<p>It is my job, oftentimes to determine what knowledge needs to be
retained and when.</p>
<p>And how.</p>
<p>It is not an easy job, but it is a fun one.</p>
<p>It may seem like it is easy to solve any of these problems, but each
and every issue is so complex, that I’ve devoted a huge portion of my
personal time to solve them (although, I tackle these issues mostly
indirectly).</p>
<p>There is no universal solution to this problem at present.</p>
<p>In different companies, the issue is cost and budget related.</p>
<p>It is too costly to retain all information, forever, while still
making it available and searchable.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I’ve been working on this for a long time to produce
approaches that can be used in specific situations and at different
companies, and aspire to have something more generally applicable.</p>
<p>Not only for companies, but for everyone.</p>
<p>This goal relates to this entire site, the technology underlying it,
it’s storage, and my personal archive, included here: <a
href="inky-fibers.html">Inky fibers</a>.</p>
<p>Matt, why did you call this article “Inky fibers”?.</p>
<p>If you think about records, historically, they amount to ink on
paper, or papyrus, primarily.</p>
<p>We have tablets too, but right now, our best way of retaining wisdom,
is on paper,</p>
<p>and not in digital formats (not yet, perhaps).</p>

and Mentors Remove Obstacles (And Other Stuff).</a></h2>
<p>A couple years ago, I attended a conference with the Congress on the
Future of Engineering Software (COFES), in Phoenix, Arizona. Many
prominent figures in engineering, software, and academia were present:
<a
href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181209181629/http://cofes.com/Events/COFES-2018/Key-Participants.aspx">Attendance
List</a>.</p>
<p>I was fortunate enough to be seated next to Mr. Stephen Tsai, a very
interesting and influential figure from Stanford University, and an
Intern. I wish I knew her name, but I do not recall it and don’t have a
clear way to find out who it was, without looking excessively eager to
find out. There were other participants, but I can’t recall their names
either.</p>
<p>Anyway, at the table we began talking about mentorship.</p>
<p>And I suddenly had an insight.</p>
<p>Mentoring needs to be about removing obstacles primarily.</p>
<p>Not about teaching, and trying to make an impression using
authoritative words and quotations.</p>
<p>We already know people are self-guided.</p>
<p>They learn, when they are interested. They are interested when
information is relevant and connects with experience.</p>
<p>What is more relevant,</p>
<p>than obstacles to present and future interests?</p>
<p>I was talking about this with the Intern, while others were listening
in.</p>
<p>Feedback seemed to indicate, that all were in agreement.</p>
<p>There was an interesting level of agreement on this topic.</p>
<p>Some unpalpable “This speaks to me, this is right.”</p>
<p>There was energy.</p>
<p>But then the conference meal started and some presentations
began.</p>
<p>But I’ll always remember that this seemed to be a conclusion,</p>
<p>worth investigating further.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Ageism is a problem.</p>
<p>Pyramids are a problem.</p>
<p>Elders want to protect their positions,</p>
<p>and block growth.</p>
<p>Removing obstacles to growth, and idea realization,</p>
<p>also means removing obstacles,</p>
<p>to incentives,</p>
<p>and funding, and elevated roles.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>How many managers, volunteer to be replaced?</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Some occlusion to advancement is necessary of course.</p>
<p>There are not enough spots at the tops of pyramids,</p>
<p>for all talent underneath.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>But think about it.</p>
<p>If we are to live in a real meritocracy,</p>
<p>then wouldn’t it end up being situated,</p>
<p>such that we would agree with the obstacles?</p>
<p>They are not artificial,</p>
<p>or subjective,</p>
<p>but are just?</p>
<p>What of the social justice,</p>
<p>of the corporate pyramid?</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>This is another post indicating that equality is not real.</p>
<p>We want to remove obstacles,</p>
<p>for talent to show itself to the maximum,</p>
<p>and allow us to rationally select.</p>
<p>We do not rationally select.</p>
<p>And we have conflicting ideas, about equality,</p>
<p>and advancement.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>But maybe the biggest issue of all,</p>
<p>is conservative values,</p>
<p>about how people are entitled to their positions.</p>
<p>Or are entitled to career growth.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>I wrote a related post before, called;</p>
<p><a
href="christopher-matthew-cavanaugh-thoughtstream.html#obstructing-corporate-turnover">Obstructing
Corporate Turnover</a></p>
<p>The idea in this post,</p>
<p>is that once you are in an organization,</p>
<p>you think you are entitled to stay, or to advance.</p>
<p>But in a meritocratic system,</p>
<p>there would be a continual rational shuffling.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the very youngest, would shoot straight to the top.</p>
<p>That this so rarely happens,</p>
<p>is an indicator that there is a problem.</p>
<p>I am just at this moment,</p>
<p>realizing it should happen <em>frequently</em>.</p>
<p>For consider the quality of talent that must exist,</p>
<p>in a company of 100,000</p>
<p>with an executive leadership of fewer than 25?</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Which executive, is ready to be replaced,</p>
<p>by the <em>genius intern</em>?</p>
<p>I’m not fond of the word <em>genius</em></p>
<p>but it works here.</p>
<p>That really intelligent intern,</p>
<p>is going to quit,</p>
<p>or be pushed out,</p>
<p>for being too talented.</p>
<p>Do you realize that?</p>

<p>Say I watch the news, and I don’t change the channel immediately
after the weather,</p>
<p>when it says something about Coronavirus?</p>
<p>The weather seems to have a clear value.</p>
<p>it impacts my decisions.</p>
<p>But I’m not clear on the value of Coronavirus news.</p>
<p>I could be mistaken, but here’s my guess.</p>
<p>I can ignore it completely, and never talk about it, never listen to
conversation about it,</p>
<p>and pretend it does not exist,</p>
<p><em>to my benefit</em></p>

<p>What is the value in USD of any particular piece of news,</p>
<p>to a person who can choose to ignore it</p>
<p>or actively listen and participate in it?</p>
<p>I feel like the core value,</p>
<p>is not saving oneself from coronavirus,</p>
<p>but in the entertainment value of gossiping about it.</p>
<p>In that case,</p>
<p>Coronavirus only needs to seem important.</p>
<p>In that case the news is creating value by exaggerating…</p>
<p>Anyway, the point has been made.</p>
<p>I don’t think I’m at any risk of contracting this virus.</p>
<p>If I do, then,</p>
<p>“Hey everyone,</p>
<p>I contracted Coronavirus.”</p>

to be Responsible, so You Can Pretend to be Special.</a></h2>
<p>Consider something horrible in the world that people pretend to want
to alleviate.</p>
<p>Starvation in other countries for example.</p>
<p>You might feel responsible for that, but I assure you, you probably
are not.</p>
<p>If you are responsible, then you are probably a killer of sorts.</p>
<p>Maybe you live there and you are diverting food to other people for
your benefit.</p>
<p>In that case you are responsible, but you are certainly not special.
At least not in a sense that you can feel good about. You might consider
that you should feel bad, about being responsible for that.</p>
<p>Maybe you are especially horrible, but you’re not good.</p>
<p>Now, let us assume you are not responsible for the starvation carnage
around the world.</p>
<p>Then in that case, you can feel great about yourself, if you do
something that actually impacts the problem to a degree.</p>
<p>You weren’t responsible, and yet you wanted to do something.</p>
<p>That’s <em>really rare.</em></p>
<p>“I just want to help them, and I know that we are not actually
responsible.”</p>
<p>Notice that usually what people say is:</p>
<p>“I wanted to help because we are responsible for it…”</p>
<p>Then they guilt you into providing money, and insist that there is
some minimum that you should provide.</p>
<p>And they’ll even help you believe you are responsible somehow.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p><em>Usually</em> the goal for a person doing this</p>
<p><em>is only to feel and act responsible</em>,</p>
<p>without ever doing anything.</p>
<p>“How does that work Mattanaw?”</p>
<p>Here’s how.</p>
<p>Suppose you feel responsible for starvation.</p>
<p>Other’s will not feel responsible.</p>
<p>You will talk to them, and probably try to convince them, that
everyone is responsible, if you feel strongly about it.</p>
<p>I’ve been there.</p>
<p>Many will disagree.</p>
<p>Suddenly you are motivated by their disagreement,</p>
<p>because you have political adversary of sorts.</p>
<p>You have someone to overcome.</p>
<p>You are convinced now, that you have a special mission.</p>
<p>You need to convince them they are responsible too.</p>
<p>But what is funny,</p>
<p>is you might come to believe that only they are responsible
really.</p>
<p>Because even though you are doing nothing,</p>
<p>by convincing them they are responsible,</p>
<p>somehow you are helping starving people who still have no food.</p>
<p>You are convincing others they have a right for food,</p>
<p>and that makes you feel like</p>
<p>they’ll get food.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Aside: Rights don’t get anyone anything. If they have it, then the
have it.].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>…</p>
<p>Now, what is funny is that people who are of this mindset,</p>
<p>become <em>less insterested</em> once <em>everyone is of the same
opinion</em>.</p>
<p>If you convince everyone to fix starvation,</p>
<p>you are no longer the starvation warrior. Everyone is.</p>
<p>You’re not special. But you’ll remind everyone,</p>
<p>that you were an early proponent.</p>
<p>Now that is valuable! If starvation was eliminated by your
efforts.</p>
<p>But being an early proponent of something that doesn’t happen,</p>
<p>might indicate that you are enlightened, and ineffective.</p>
<p>Oops, you focused on feeling enlightened.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>I see this in the actions of Vegan people myself.</p>
<p>Although they are quite right in insisting that everyone is
responsible, who eats meat.</p>
<p>They are actually right.</p>
<p>Consumerism has an impact.</p>
<p>But like the people who pretend to be responsible,</p>
<p>the Vegans want to feel unique.</p>
<p>“The few of us are fixing this problem, and I am getting
attention.”</p>
<p>Notice the attention requires, for the problem <em>to
exist</em>!!</p>
<p>“I get my meaning from the fact that you eat meat.”</p>
<p>Personally, as a long time Vegan,</p>
<p>I’m excited for when it will become a non-issue, and everyone is
Vegan.</p>
<p>Then maybe the word “vegan” falls out of favor,</p>
<p>because everyone is that.</p>
<p>Or there are synthetic meat products that do not harm animals,</p>
<p>although they may actually be farmed from real animal tissues.</p>
<p>I will happily call myself a vegan,</p>
<p>even though everyone else is a vegan too.</p>
<p>Although like everyone else,</p>
<p>I’ll probably look for a new problem,</p>
<p>to make myself feel more special again,</p>
<p>for being unique.</p>
<p>See how that works?</p>
<p>It doesn’t end.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>I’ll try not to feel special,</p>
<p>until someone who is a meat eater,</p>
<p>insists they always were on the side of the animal rights
advocates.</p>
<p>You weren’t.</p>
<p>Like the people who were on the side of slavery,</p>
<p>you were on the side of animal cruelty.</p>
<p>But I won’t derive my importance from the existence of a problem
either.</p>
<p>When the problem is over, I’ll only invoke</p>
<p>“Special Vegan Mattanaw”</p>
<p>to counter the</p>
<p>“Liar.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>It is fairly sad that this is the reality.</p>
<p>When people notice that there is a worldwide problem,</p>
<p>that they are <em>not</em> responsible for,</p>
<p>they pretend to take responsibility,</p>
<p>and</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>they do nothing to alleviate the problem, and</li>
<li>they derive attention by setting themselves apart, and</li>
<li>they create guilt by making other people feel responsible.</li>
</ol>
<p>…</p>
<p>We need to be watchful for this type of person.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>They aren’t actually <em>doing</em> anything,</p>
<p>but learning about something they don’t like,</p>
<p>and taking a position on the topic.</p>
<p>It’s shocking how common that is.</p>
<p>Don’t you hate homelessness?</p>
<p>I do to.</p>
<p>It’s sad.</p>
<p>And what else?</p>
<p>Nothing else. It will continue and you’ll just talk.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>One more example.</p>
<p>This example is better.</p>
<p>You can feel important, by pretending you are responsible for “Sin”
in the world.</p>
<p>Then you can pretend that you are responsible for saving people from
“Hell”.</p>
<p>However, you are not actually responsible for these things.</p>
<p>neither exists…</p>
<p>They are not distant like starvation.</p>
<p>They don’t exist <em>at all</em>!</p>
<p>Since neither exists, and neither can be fixed (you can’t fix a
problem that doesn’t exist),</p>
<p>then you are pretending.</p>
<p>And you are taking actions that don’t result in anything.</p>
<p>And you make yourself special, because only you,</p>
<p>or some designated few (a “remnant”) can fix it.</p>
<p>So you’ve done exactly what I’ve mentioned above.</p>
<p>You’ve self-designated yourself as important.</p>
<p>You pretended that you were responsible so that you could pretend
that you are special.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Another totally different approach that you can follow is:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Acknowledge that you are <em>not</em> responsible.</li>
<li>Acknowledge that other people are not either, and that they
therefore don’t have to do <em>anything</em> to fix it, even if you
think you should, <em>because you are interested</em>.</li>
<li>Choose a problem that exists, that you can work on. [It needs to
exist.]</li>
<li>Actually do something to solve the problem.</li>
</ol>
<p>Again, saving people from “Hell” is not actually doing anything.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The crazy thing is that people who don’t think much about “Hell” or
“Sin”</p>
<p>will become angry with this sort of thing.</p>
<p>But they never do anything about it ever!</p>
<p>They just get annoyed, when they hear someone say, it doesn’t
exist!</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Don’t be like these people.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>You are unique, and so you are special in a sense.</li>
<li>You should actually do things instead of pretending to do them.</li>
<li>You are not responsible for much that is wrong in the world.</li>
<li>Other people are not responsible either, largely.</li>
<li>Personal value doesn’t depend on “making the world a better
place.”</li>
</ol>
<p>If you accept these things, suddenly you might feel just fine how you
are.</p>
<p>Then you won’t feel like you need to pretend to be responsible for
what you’re not responsible for.</p>
<p>But you can still choose something you’re interested in,</p>
<p>and focus on making improvements,</p>
<p>so that you make real changes in the world, that you can feel good
about.</p>
<p>Make sure that change you choose exists,</p>
<p>and isn’t “Saving people from Sin or Hell.”</p>

Forevr. When the Editor Who Can, Chooses Not To.</a></h2>
<p>So today, I looked at my post from yesterday night.</p>
<p>There are some grammatical problems, and typos.</p>
<p>Mostly typos.</p>
<p>I can distinguish “its” from “it’s”.</p>
<p>Obviously, I know “an” is not “and”.</p>
<p>Yet I decided to leave it there for eternity.</p>
<p>Or for however long it can be there.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Some readers believe,</p>
<p>their reactions to typos, justifies</p>
<p>summary inferences about the writer.</p>
<p>But we know that is fallacious,</p>
<p>so I won’t even go there.</p>
<p>Waste of time.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>But here’s what I will say.</p>
<p>I probably typed 10,000 words yesterday before writing that post.</p>
<p>For my course at Harvard University;</p>
<p>for a book I’m writing in another class led by a Georgetown
Professor;</p>
<p>for some writing relating to my legal case that I’m self representing
myself on;</p>
<p>regarding a large tract of land I procured in my occupation,</p>
<p>leading companies with my</p>
<p>writing;</p>
<p>And programming (i.e. the code runs);</p>
<p>and chats with a couple beautifully smart friends I talk with
regularly.</p>
<p>Now, ask me if I care at all,</p>
<p>if I mistype “it’s” and it comes out “its”.</p>
<p>My multiple degrees and certs are still over there beside me.</p>
<p>I promise you “Edit everything to perfection”</p>
<p>is not a strategy.</p>
<p>“I don’t know a better rule than this”</p>
<p>is really what that person should say.</p>
<p>It’s seriously the dictum of an imbecile,</p>
<p>with very little understanding of the subtleties,</p>
<p>of quality advice.</p>
<p>Fine, for the grade student,</p>
<p>“Try to correct it so you actually know how ultimately.”</p>
<p>Kinda makes sense.</p>
<p>But guess what, already you made my point in that.</p>
<p>Your twitter message,</p>
<p>is not a billboard on Times Square.</p>
<p>And meaning and productivity,</p>
<p>come first. Not second.</p>
<p>Make a ton of sense in bad grammar and be productive,</p>
<p>and let other people make no sense in perfect grammar and let them be
unproductive.</p>
<p>They’re always going to be scared of people,</p>
<p>who will judge them,</p>
<p>like they judge everyone else.</p>
<p>This post is not only about grammar,</p>
<p>can you tell?</p>
<p>If I spoke that last post out loud with lisps and errors,</p>
<p>you would probably receive the message.</p>
<p>And I already published it.</p>
<p>What did you publish yesterday,</p>
<p>grammar critic?</p>
<p>Look at my typos</p>
<p>and understand I’m ok with them being typos</p>

<h2
id="when-big-data-is-just-data."><a name="when-big-data-is-just-data">When
big data, is just data.</a></h2>
<p>There are some limitations on how much data, can be stored in
anyone’s repository.</p>
<p>However, in marketing,</p>
<p>we see the obvious advancement,</p>
<p>of pulling records together on individuals,</p>
<p>about how they are using software,</p>
<p>across channels and across devices.</p>
<p>So when will these massive data sets</p>
<p>be made available to everyone?</p>
<p>You have our data,</p>
<p>when can you provide it back</p>
<p>to us?</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>There’s a problem.</p>
<p>When the data set gets large enough,</p>
<p>it becomes infeasible to provide an interface</p>
<p>to all that data.</p>
<p>It becomes especially impossible,</p>
<p>to provide the data.</p>
<p>Because a user will not be able to afford,</p>
<p>the storage hardware.</p>
<p>This problem could become permanently</p>
<p>insoluble.</p>
<p>If we wait too long to solve it.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Here is a concern about privacy again.</p>
<p>I don’t have rights to your data.</p>
<p>You don’t have rights to mine.</p>
<p>But why do we care?</p>
<p>Why are we willing to give a company</p>
<p>access to <em>all of the data</em> without</p>
<p>accepting anything in return?</p>
<p>By pitting you against me,</p>
<p>and me against you,</p>
<p>in our unwillingness for each other,</p>
<p>to know each other completely,</p>
<p>we allow them to have everything.</p>
<p>The conjunction of data of all people.</p>
<p>While we get,</p>
<p>some tiny subset of the whole.</p>
<p>If I permit you to see me,</p>
<p>and you permit me to see you,</p>
<p>we have a right to all of the data…</p>
<p>well, we can make the case for obtaining such a right.</p>
<p>Or, in my way of saying it,</p>
<p>we’ll have a way for obtaining it…</p>
<p>(You can cut out the word “right” entirely).</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Think about it.</p>
<p>Do you know how software companies</p>
<p>can control information?</p>
<p>They can say:</p>
<p>My software holds it an it is costly.</p>
<p>My software processes it and its costly.</p>
<p>We would have to write software to provide access,</p>
<p>and that’s costly.</p>
<p>And… we are in business, to have</p>
<p>Intellectual Property,</p>
<p>based what we learn from</p>
<p>our software.</p>
<p>And you are our experiment.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Experiment.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>When I took Psychology courses at the University of Maryland,</p>
<p>we covered the process for conducting a study,</p>
<p>which involved getting approval,</p>
<p>as to the Ethics.</p>
<p>It is not easy. It is complex.</p>
<p>But guess what?</p>
<p>In software,</p>
<p>You are a study and you don’t even know it.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>What subset of data can be made available to everyone,</p>
<p>and what subset remains proprietary,</p>
<p>and how is the distinction justified?</p>
<p>This is a fundamental decision that needs to be</p>
<p>openly decided.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Oddly enough, I don’t really see much</p>
<p>democratization of data happening,</p>
<p>given Democracy.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>I am perpetually saddened,</p>
<p>by how silly America is,</p>
<p>in its pretense of having things,</p>
<p>it doesn’t have.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>How can I have</p>
<p>My data lake?</p>

<h2
id="the-cure-to-fatty-clogs-of-death."><a name="the-cure-to-fatty-clogs-of-death">The
Cure to Fatty Clogs of Death.</a></h2>
<p>Recently a friend on Facebook, Rio Zak, posted an article about how
extra protein may encourage plaques to build up on blood vessels. At
least as may be indicated by a study on mice. I added a comment to
challenge, not her, but the article shared, at least with respect to its
guiding motivation, which can perhaps be surmised.</p>
<p>The article she shared is this one: <a
href="https://medicine.wustl.edu/news/high-protein-diets-boost-artery-clogging-plaque-mouse-study-shows/?fbclid=IwAR1_MPpgImhvF1WDy1cgniudmunBpm0MNeE19rjSci-rKn4UgtrcjwUjJhY">High-protein
diets boost artery-clogging plaque, mouse study shows.</a></p>
<p>Fatty clogs result in strokes, heart attacks, and various other
conditions that probably account for the majority of premature deaths in
the Western World.</p>
<p>“Premature” in the sense that an alternative lifestyle would easily
increase life-span to, or beyond, whatever the average happens to be for
a region.</p>
<p>Here is my opinion on this topic:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“I find this to be unlikely if the diet is both vegan and high in
protein, because as usual, the study’s design is for the normal
population, and not those who are not consuming a high fat, diet, with
saturated fats and cholesterol.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Plaque contains a mix of fat, cholesterol, calcium deposits and
dead cells.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>So the easiest solution is to not eat anything that would result
in a plaque to begin with, like Bill Clinton ended up doing.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Using myself as an example, I don’t eat any cholesterol, and eat
only some saturated fat, which I would be better off not doing, because
I bought a tub of coconut oil and am feeling too cheap to throw it away
(and I should).</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>You can see my blood tests results here indicating low
cholesterol levels, low VLDL, HDL, etc…:</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em><a href="http://cmcavanaugh.com/open-health-mattanaw.html">Open
Health</a></em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>So even if I eat a high protein diet (and I eat a very high
protein diet now for bodybuilding), I will probably not end up with much
plaque.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Now if I decided I was not going to be vegan any longer, and I
ate a combination of a high protein diet, with high cholesterol, maybe I
would have more to worry about, by adding more protein. This is the kind
of thing that makes me think that such studies are misguided
though.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>It seems that researchers are really concerned about how to not
change the typical diet that’s rich in fat and cholesterol.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, the desire to avoid the conclusion that the vegan
diet is beneficial (or a near vegan, near vegetarian diet, which is what
I advocate), results in studies that have a poor design.</p>
<p>What’s the other cure for my problems since I cannot make the
changes, the doctor should be recommending?</p>
<p>This attitude ends up controlling the imaginations of scientists in
their considerations about what studies should be conducted.</p>
<p>When I die, it will probably not be due to fatty clogs.</p>
<p>I can’t control for all variables but this is a great one to control
for.</p>
<p>As people already know in theory,</p>
<p>but not in practice.</p>

<p>The difference appears to be due to changes in perspective influenced
by courses on economics, but I can’t quite tell.</p>
<p>I’m highly averse to answering questions like these, because I see
correct, or representative answers, as going one way or the other,
depending on how the question is extended. In other words, it depends on
the meaning of the question, while the meaning is not actually provided
for.</p>
<p>I think that people are mostly mistaken, if they think that the
questions mean what they think they mean, except in a few cases.</p>
<p>A better test would be one that is more detailed, where fewer readers
are able to understand the questions, for increased specificity and less
generality.</p>

make it less accurate.</p>

id="when-never-give-up-is-not-the-answer."><a name="when-never-give-up-is-not-the-answer">When
“Never give up” is not the answer.</a></h2>
<p>As a Determinist, I think whether someone gives up or not, is
predetermined.</p>
<p>“Giving up” is given a negative connotation in America, but that is
lamentable.</p>
<p>There are triumphs that have resulted from perseverance in one
direction.</p>
<p>But the are triumphs that have resulted, from changing course
too.</p>
<p>“Never give up” and “Learn something new” are both recommended.</p>
<p>What do I choose and when?</p>
<p>On LinkedIn I encountered a post, sharing a video from Deshauna
Barber.</p>
<p>You can find the original video here: <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f8vpS4IRk0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f8vpS4IRk0</a></p>
<p>She experienced triumph after <em>many</em> failed attempts to win
Miss USA.</p>
<p>Finally she won. Who does not feel glad she won, after watching a
video such as this one?</p>
<p>As usual, I disagree with the message, however, although not
entirely.</p>
<p>I think a more subtle, and more useful message can be delivered,
using this same experience.</p>
<p>“Giving up” is wise.</p>
<p>Mathematically, giving up is a <em>frequently</em> recurring, and
important decision that one has to make, and can make well, in many
different circumstances.</p>
<p>As you age, you will need to give things up.</p>
<p>Giving up is not incompatible with perseverance.</p>
<p>Maybe what she is hoping to instill in people is that they should
have perseverance about things that are really possible to them.</p>
<p>However, in the world, there is competition, and if everyone were to
follow this message, it is not clear that perseverance would result in
the same result.</p>
<p>Because in competition, one has to have something different from the
others to succeed.</p>
<p>She may have won because she had more perseverance than the others,
but it is hard to imagine, that her speech is about teaching her
competition to have as much perseverance as she had, if not more.</p>
<p>Here is my comment from LinkedIn regarding this.</p>
<p>It may appear negative, but I assure you, it is not.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Never give up” is not the best message coming out of this
though. The message is to “not give up when there is a reasonable
expectation of success” where the results expected are better than
alternatives. Because she would not have won any of her pageants if she
was not already close, and there were many who tried and had no chance
at all. In that case, the experience alone may justify the work, but the

<p>It will make whoever does the changes,</p>
<p>strange,</p>
<p>for a bit but then it will just be normal.</p>
<p>If it catches on.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Amazon sent me a message,</p>
<p>saying “We’ve found a suggestion for you”</p>
<p>with some product information for something I searched for
myself.</p>
<p>I think it was in my mailbox.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The problem with this is that the Marketing/Advertisement</p>
<p>is lying to me.</p>
<ul>
<li>An Amazon “we” did not send anything. Amazon’s software did…
<ul>
<li>There was no person who sent the message. Not even one.</li>
<li>It takes two people to make a “we”.</li>
<li>It is a lie. It is false.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>There is no person involved in this.
<ul>
<li>This means that they are trying to give the impression that someone
is helping me.</li>
<li>There is no someone.</li>
<li>They are not helping. They are looking for a sale.</li>
<li>Therefore there are multiple lies in this. Multiple false
elements.</li>
<li>If I believed this, I would have a false understanding of the
interaction, intentions, etc…</li>
</ul></li>
<li>There was no “suggestion”.
<ul>
<li>No one did any work to see if this is something I need.</li>
<li>This is not a product I was unaware of.</li>
<li>I searched for this product myself, creating the analytics data they
stored, connected with my identity.</li>
<li>This information was something I knew about sent back to me.</li>
<li>Therefore I did the work to create the data in part, and linked it
to myself.</li>
<li>Therefore, if anything, the information was partly from myself,
since it was initiated with my interaction.</li>
<li>Therefore Amazon lied. It is false. There was no suggestion.</li>
<li>A computer simply read through my history, and spit back to me a
product I already saw.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>This is why in a previous posting, I said “There is no wisdom in the
marketing.”</p>
<p>This is hyperbolic.</p>
<p>Marketers are people who can have wisdom.</p>
<p>But the ads, and the propaganda, is designed to</p>
<p>Manipulate us, with lies, fabrications, false directives about what’s
in our best interest.</p>
<p>It’s contrary to education.</p>
<p>Education is for wisdom.</p>
<p>We have to educate people to be wise enough to avoid marketing,</p>
<p>and to see through ads.</p>
<p>Some are not smart enough to do this,</p>
<p>even with education.</p>
<p>Everyone has trouble doing it all the time,</p>
<p>because of limited energy,</p>
<p>since stimulus in our environments cannot be controlled,</p>
<p>and we cannot always direct our logical minds,</p>
<p>to anything that might catch our attention,</p>
<p>or our subconsciousness.</p>
<p>This is why I said that there is no wisdom in the marketing.</p>
<p>Of all things we aim to achieve,</p>
<p>with Wisdom,</p>
<p>is to see through what Marketing is trying to gain</p>
<p>from us.</p>
<p>Marketing does not care,</p>
<p>what it might do to you,</p>
<p>to get what it wants.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Do you want to educate your children,</p>
<p>well enough to see through this marketing,</p>
<p>and attain wisdom?</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>To be able to see through the marketing,</p>
<p>enables one to see through,</p>
<p>lies, false authority, and almost any other manipulation tactic you
can think of!</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The Amazon ad could have said:</p>
<p>Our system saw that you were reviewing this product,</p>
<p>and Amazon would like you to consider purchasing it again.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>It is still something I do not wish to see,</p>
<p>which is a violation. Because I prefer to buy,</p>
<p>when I’m looking.</p>
<p>I didn’t ask Amazon to consume my attention,</p>
<p>when I paid for that Prime membership.</p>
<p>There are too many things to opt out of,</p>
<p>to ensure, that I don’t see that ad,</p>
<p>when I’m on <em>someone else’s website</em>.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>I’m afraid,</p>
<p>people don’t care about their kids,</p>
<p>as much as they think and say they do.</p>

<h2
id="creating-an-oxygen-rich-living-environment."><a name="creating-an-oxygen-rich-living-environment">Creating
an oxygen rich living environment.</a></h2>
<p>One current interest of mine is exploring how exactly we can improve
the oxygen concentration in our living atmosphere.</p>
<p>How can we increase the amount of oxygen available to us in our
homes, or in our cars, or other contained environments?</p>
<p>After doing some cursory research, I have stumbled upon a few
options.</p>
<p>The first option would be to go to a doctor and either pretend to
have a medical condition, or reveal a medical condition, such that you
will get medical treatment using specialty devices, that allow you to
obtain oxygen and administer oxygen to yourself.</p>
<p>I don’t want to do that at all.</p>
<p>So on to option two.</p>
<p>For option two, I’m considering visiting a supplier of oxygen who
sells tanks for various purposes. For example, it appears that you can
buy pure oxygen for burning with torches used for welding (the oxygen
would allow for a hotter burn than would be possible in the normal
concentrations found in the atmosphere). Not having hardly any
experience welding, and no certification, I will discover soon whether
or not I’m allowed to purchase it. I’m thinking it might be a controlled
material.</p>
<p>If it is not a controlled material, or is not cost prohibitive, I
will buy a large tank of it, and along with that tank, purchase a gas
level detector that can read out, in the least, the amount of oxygen
present in the immediate environment to at least a tenth of a decimal
place. This way, I can open up the oxygen tank valve to a certain
degree, and test how much the percentage of oxygen present in the
environment will increase, and to what degree it will fluctuate. With
some experience, I can then find a way to control the environment such
that air transfer is understood, and the amount of oxygen lost over
time, to become closer to the amount on average present in the
atmosphere can be determined, and how long it takes for that transition
to occur. Finally, I can then gauge the costs associated with it and see
to what extent it is realistic to continue to take this approach.</p>
<p>A third option that I considered, is the use of household plants.</p>
<p>The use of household plants appears to be completely debunked as a
viable method of producing oxygen in the home to an appreciable degree.
From what I have read, it appears that the amount of oxygen produced,
and CO<sub>2</sub> absorbed, are determined by plant respiration and
photosynthesis, in very predictable way. The amount of oxygen produced,
depends on the growth of the plants in the home, and in conjunction with
the chemical reaction formula for photosynthesis measurement of the
growth of the plant, can be used to estimate the contribution of oxygen
the plants will make to the local atmosphere. It appears that the plants
would need to grow almost a pound a day to make any contribution
whatsoever, and this would require having a small jungle within a living
space, and even in that case, it may not be as impactful as one might
hope. So I ruled this out as an option, preferring instead, to simply
buy the gas from those who are able to separate it and bottle it.</p>
<p>The final option, option four, is to separate the gas from the
atmosphere myself.</p>
<p>After some review of the process on YouTube, it appears that whatever
approach you use, you will end up with a small industrial multi-phasic
refinery of sorts. Two methodologies are used from what I see. The first
employs playing with temperatures of the gaseous mixtures to ultimately
vapor or liquid distill the mixture until ultimately oxygen is
separated, because for each element, there is a different boiling point
and freezing point that can be used to separate them out. This process
is not simplistic and it requires liquification and/or freezing of each
of the gasses of the atmosphere, with temperatures at play as low as
−182.96 Celsius, which is the boiling point of Oxygen. It is lower for
Argon and Nitrogen, and this is how they can be separated from one
another at low temperatures. Overall, I don’t see this as being
feasible, unless I were to opt to spend very large amounts of money one
1) creating a laboratory, or 2) buying the tools that amount to a small
refinery.</p>
<p>The second approach seems to be more modern, but less precise in the
separation (recall that vapor distillation of water uses a similar
process and results in pure water, at about 99.99% or better [and
assumption with no research]). This other process uses small porous
minerals called zeolytes as filters of the mixture of gases that can
bond with argon or nitrogen. It may be used in a multi-phased system
that also has some distillation process, but from one system I was
examining on YouTube that is for sale, it uses these zeolytes multiple
times, to gain an ever increasing level of Oxygen purity, kindof like a
multi-phased water treatment system. Just like with a filter based water
treatment system, purity probably does not approach vapor distilled, at
least for rudimentary systems. This zeolytic system appears to produce
Oxygen purity of 99.5% or better. But again, this process is very
expensive, and there is no way to construct, by myself, a system that
uses Zeolytes. It seems more feasible to create a system that separates
based on temperature alone, than to purchase zeolytes and incorporate
them into such a system.</p>
<p>So at this moment, it appears I will take the easy way out, and
purchase oxygen tanks, and procure a oxygen sensor.</p>
<p>I have not been researching this long (about an hour), so if anyone
has any interest in this topic, or experience improving the oxygen
concentration of a local atmosphere (at home or in a lab), please let me
know via <a href="mailto:mattanaw@mattanaw.com">email</a>.</p>
<p>BTW, I am aware that Oxygen is an explosive material, and highly
flammable. Nevertheless, it is in the air, so I will have it one way or
another.</p>

<p>Whenever I used to meet someone new,</p>

<p>I suspect some others thought that was a weird</p>

<p>If they didn’t recognize that intent,</p>
<p>maybe instead</p>
<p>they were more</p>
<p>just trained to be ready to forget someone</p>
<p>after an interaction.</p>
<p>I was never that way before.</p>
<p>But slowly I’m becoming</p>
<p>this other kind of person.</p>
<p>We just met,</p>
<p>and that’s that I guess.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>I have many friends,</p>
<p>on social media,</p>

<p>I remember you.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>It’s impossible to get to know everyone well,</p>
<p>or follow up with everyone</p>
<p>you ever meet.</p>
<p>So maybe there is a lesson that took me a long time to learn.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Every person I met was a new relationship in progress.</p>
<p>“How do I build on this conversation?”</p>
<p>“What can I say I will improve in myself based on this chat?”</p>
<p>“How can I show someone I valued them</p>
<p>and what they said enough</p>
<p>that I made a personal change?”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>When I meet someone new now,</p>
<p>I mostly think it is over</p>

Liar or Lunatic”, i<sup>th</sup>-chotomies, and complexity calling for
math. </a></h2>
<p>There is a book called “Evidence that Demands a Verdict”, that says
that we are to ask ourselves, if one particular prophet is the Lord, is
a Liar, or is a Lunatic.</p>
<p>The error here is one of a false trichotomy of sorts.</p>
<p>It’s a salesman’s tactic, used to channel people, like cattle,
through one door, and then through one of three other doors.</p>
<p>What about, when something is just fiction?</p>
<p>Or an admixture of fact and fiction, with many tangles?</p>
<p>“Tangleebuses”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Aside: Pronounced: “Tangle eeeee bus es”. It’s not a real word.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>…</p>
<p>Many are aware of the phrase “false dichotomies”. Dividing something
into two when that division is illusory.</p>
<p>The way that that illusion can play out depends on many factors.</p>
<p>This is a false trichotomy.</p>
<p>But there is no limit to the types of labyrinths you can send cattle
into.</p>
<p>OR people.</p>
<p>There are false i<sup>th</sup>-chotomies.</p>
<p>Or just massive multi-level trees on trees on trees of
i<sup>th</sup>-chotomies.</p>
<p>Many branches and dendrites on three or more dimensions.</p>
<p>The spatially limited won’t often go there.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>So whenever you hear someone say “false dichotomy”,</p>
<p>think to yourself</p>
<p>“This could be much more complex than that,</p>
<p>and a mathematical representation is probably much</p>
<p>better suited for the job.’</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>I’m no professional mathematician, in the sense</p>
<p>that all I do is math,</p>
<p>but I imagine,</p>
<p>this is the pain in the mind of the Mathematician,</p>
<p>who knows that almost every problem encountered,</p>
<p>is far more complicated,</p>
<p>than ordinary language permits,</p>
<p>them to discuss,</p>
<p>or other people to understand.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Yes I care about you,</p>
<p>Person Mathematician.</p>
<p>“Person” is an honorific here.</p>
<p>Pr. Mathematician.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Did <em>this</em> bring some relief, to you?</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Relief for one person,</p>
<p>is not relief for the other.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>So the work must be finished,</p>
<p>for each person to get the relief,</p>
<p>they need from the master work.</p>

<p>…</p>
<p>Got rights?</p>
<p>Or do you have to</p>
<p>do something</p>
<p>to secure whatever it is you need?</p>
<p>In that case,</p>
<p>Why not just say,</p>
<p>You can play the game,</p>
<p>and pay the money,</p>
<p>and provide the effort,</p>
<p>and <em>maybe</em></p>
<p>you’ll have what you’re</p>
<p><em>hoping for</em>,</p>
<p>that you don’t actually have secured</p>
<p>until you have it secured.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>What’s the difference between,</p>
<p>fighting for something you need,</p>
<p>and fighting for your rights?</p>
<p>Fighting for what you need,</p>
<p>is less confusing,</p>
<p>because there is no middle <em>thing</em></p>

is not in your religion.</a></h2>
<p>Good news though,</p>
<p>Karma isn’t real.</p>
<p>Karma isn’t a strategy.</p>
<p>It is an idea devoid of depth.</p>
<p>It isn’t even desirable.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Aside: more on this point later].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The guilty think that Karma is real,</p>
<p>more than the innocent.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Let’s think it over together.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>If you did something wrong when you were young,</p>
<p>you are watchful.</p>
<p>You feel guilty.</p>
<p>When the same happens to you later,</p>
<p>you think:</p>
<p>“I deserved this.”</p>
<p>But what you forgot,</p>
<p>is that whatever you did,</p>
<p>others also do,</p>
<p>and so you simply became the victim,</p>
<p>of a common indiscretion.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>If you were angry,</p>
<p>and someone becomes angry with you,</p>
<p>was it Karma?</p>
<p>No. People get angry.</p>
<p>If you stole,</p>
<p>and someone steals from you,</p>
<p>was it Karma?</p>
<p>No. People steal.</p>
<p>If you killed,</p>
<p>then someone killed a loved one of your own,</p>
<p>was that Karma?</p>
<p>No. People kill each other.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>If you move into the Ghetto,</p>
<p>you can expect MORE Karma,</p>
<p>for your same past?</p>
<p>This is nonsense.</p>
<p>You will experience more violence,</p>
<p>and crime,</p>
<p>because you relocated,</p>
<p>to a high crime area…</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The innocent don’t perceive Karma as readily.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>They will be harmed,</p>
<p>far far more,</p>
<p>than any harm they created.</p>
<p>Especially if they live in poverty.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>If you were raped as a child,</p>
<p>what was that Karma for?</p>
<p>You didn’t even live enough life,</p>
<p>for Karma.</p>
<p>Will good suddenly be thrust upon you?</p>
<p>If you are poor,</p>
<p>you might starve to death,</p>
<p>soon afterwards.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>There is no Karma.</p>
<p>“What goes around comes around”,</p>
<p>arises in the mind of the person,</p>
<p>exposed to a sentence repeatedly.</p>
<p>It springs to my mind.</p>
<p>But I cancel it out.</p>
<p>Because it is foolish.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>There is no connection</p>
<p>between past events,</p>
<p>and causally disconnected</p>
<p>events occurring later.</p>
<p>If you lied when you were six,</p>
<p>and someone lies to you as an adult,</p>
<p>there is no relationship.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>If bad things happen to you as an adult,</p>
<p>late in life,</p>
<p>it is not because you are being punished.</p>
<p>It is because these things happen.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Those who died in Hiroshima,</p>
<p>and Nagasaki,</p>
<p>minding their own business,</p>
<p>died,</p>
<p>not out of Karma,</p>
<p>but because of a war.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Shit happens”</p>
<p>is a much better way to look at things.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>What of those who want Justice?</p>
<p>Who wants Karma?</p>
<p>Karma is not Justice?</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Think I’m wrong?</p>
<p>Explain to me in detail what Justice is.</p>
<p>When you fail,</p>
<p>then recognize you don’t know how Karma</p>
<p>can be just.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>After that failure,</p>
<p>tell me what the strategy of Karma is,</p>
<p>in detail.</p>
<p>Show how it is more just,</p>
<p>than the Justice system,</p>
<p>and that it actually does the work,</p>
<p>Karma says it does.</p>
<p>How much time is required?</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>When you fail,</p>
<p>then tell me why we have a justice system.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>After all this,</p>
<p>it should be seen,</p>
<p>that the Justice System,</p>
<p>was created because,</p>
<p>there is no Karma whatsoever.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Karma is not Christian.</p>
<p>Karma is not Muslim.</p>
<p>Karma is not Jewish.</p>
<p>Karma has made its way into American culture.</p>
<p>Like most other things in American culture,</p>
<p>people have no clue about the origin.</p>

You are on more than one cycle of activity and inactivity.</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>[Aside: this was in response to a question from an administrator and
friend who asked: “Do you ever suffer from burnout? What helps you deal
with it effectively?”]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am on a cycle. Sometimes I have periods that are less active, and
confuse them for burnout, for depression, etc… But as soon as I have a
responsibility, or a calling, a down period can be immediately stopped,
and high activity can commence.</p>
<p>Sometimes, I just need to resume exercise, or get out of the darkness
of winter, etc…</p>
<p>I found that as I accepted my cycle, I became more productive and
realistic. Downtime is fine.</p>
<p>After exercise, you must recover.</p>
<p>Humanity operates on an economic cycle as well.</p>
<p>I deal with it, to a large degree, by waiting for whatever that next
impetus to action happens to be. I can’t make it happen necessarily. It
is just triggered. With acceptance, we can wait, and find that trigger,
or let something from outside us be the trigger, once it arrives. <em>It
will arrive</em>.</p>
<p>We do not question that we must sleep to recover, and do not judge
our active lives on the basis of our periods of motionless, paralyzed,
prolonged daily episodes of sleep.</p>
<p>We should not be surprised that we have more than one cycle happening
in our lives.</p>
<p>The way that I’ve come to deal with it, is to not give up on
activities simply because downtime happened.</p>
<p>If you resume where you left off, and maximize your productivity when
you have energy, you will build on what you were doing before. You will
find new ways to make use of what you were doing before. And, you will
find that while you were having downtime, or a time of burnout, you were
learning about yourself and were slowly changing. You were really like a
moth in a cocoon.</p>
<p>You still want to find the motivation to become active again.</p>
<p>But as long as you build on who you were before, you’re growing.</p>

and Grounds for Rejecting It.</a></h2>
<p>[Edit: This is not a post against <em>having</em> empathy. I’m
strongly in favor of being an empathetic person. This is an analytical
post meant for providing elucidation about empathy, especially since it
can be abused by others.]</p>
<p>A friend on Facebook asked a group a question regarding this, and I
included the thoughts below as a comment.</p>
<p>I thought it would be worthwhile to share here as well (with some
minor modifications), in case anyone happens to find it useful:</p>
<p>Some thoughts.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Empathy is not easily disentangled from other states you might
witness in another person, since mental states are complex and admit of
admixtures, and</li>
<li>people transition over time in and out of various mixed states.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Example issue.</em> Would you consider this scenario one that
reflects empathy or not?: “I’m warm and empathetic, while I’m
simultaneously planning something contrary to your interests, and later
today, I will recall interactions with you, in another mood and state of
mind, that does not include empathy.”</p>
<p>Questions: Which empathetic states, correlate with which outcomes?
Are empathetic states frequently the controlling factors, or are
admixtures of states happening over time the more important
consideration? (Let’s measure the state along different aspects, along
with other elements of the person’s behavior and personality, and then
judge the value of their empathy and to what extent we should respond to
it or reject “it” [socially or conceptually])</p>
<p>I would certainly reject someone’s empathy if it doesn’t really
factor into outcomes with them. A person can be empathetic in the moment
and then later switch into an unempathetic state (due to stress, drug
use, personality disorder, or other factors), and take action against
you.</p>
<p>I would reject the concept of “empathy” if it can’t be <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operationalization">operationalized</a>
given the entanglement with other mental states over time (Is it really
entangled, or are we just artificially grouping states together, and is
there really an “it” or are we creating a false unity). I’m inclined to
think that “empathy” is something admitting of distinctions, but that we
are not advanced enough to make or use such distinctions effectively.
Instead we just feel it out, and ‘reject’ it when it feels like it makes
sense to reject it.</p>
<p>Everyone rejects empathy in practice from time to time, when it is
perceived that empathy has less force in an interaction than it appears
to have, as when someone is being manipulated.</p>
<p>Potential summary thoughts:</p>
<p>Empathy is complex, even though it appears we can find people in whom
it is totally absent, and those who have it in greater supply. So in the
human being it is both discrete (you have it or you don’t), and admits
of degrees and characteristics of expression when it is present.</p>
<p>Empathy cannot be easily teased out from other states, all the time.
This is why it is really risky to claim that someone does not have any
empathy. They might not exhibit it the way you expect, or might turn it
off, or might express other traits and mental states more obviously than
the empathy they are also experiencing.</p>
<p>People who are skilled socially have intuitions supporting their
decisions about how and to what extent someone’s empathetic behavior
should be considered in responses to their behavior, and when empathy
does or does not work as a useful concept in a given situation.</p>
<p>That not everyone who is socially skilled does this in the same way
tells us about the complexities involved.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>This post is simultaneously logical and warm.</p>

Veterans with the truth.</a></h2>
<p>Below is a post from earlier this year,</p>
<p>that became relevant again.</p>
<p><a
href="christopher-matthew-cavanaugh-thoughtstream.html#memorial-day">Original
here</a></p>
<p>Among the biggest contradictions I can think of in American
culture,</p>
<p>is that we honor veterans for their sacrifices,</p>
<p>but have trouble supporting them when they return injured,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Aside: Why is this there a need to <em>donate</em> to support
veterans who have been maimed? Obviously they aren’t being cared for
effectively.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and then we use their heroism,</p>
<p>for recruiting purposes?…</p>
<p>and to convince people it is worthwhile,</p>
<p>to be deployed overseas,</p>
<p>to risk becoming killed,</p>
<p>or risk being permanently altered?</p>
<p><em>Honor them with the truth.</em></p>
<h2 id="memorial-day-thoughts."><a name="memorial-day-thoughts">Memorial
Day Thoughts.</a></h2>
<p>Let’s honor veterans with the truths due to them.</p>
<p>I’ve said elsewhere, that</p>
<p>“Remember Forever”,</p>
<p>is not genuine.</p>
<p>People will forget just one day later.</p>
<p>And remember the phrase, when the ritual repeats, a year later.</p>
<p>This sounds negative to say.</p>
<p>But think it through, and you will see…</p>
<p>that people who sacrifice themselves in war,</p>
<p>are sacrificed completely.</p>
<p>Our memories are short.</p>
<p>When America is no more,</p>
<p>and we are blended with other nations,</p>
<p>memorials will lose significance.</p>
<p>So let’s think hard about it now,</p>
<p>and not plan to remember for eternity.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Is this not a more real,</p>
<p>and important message,</p>
<p>than any lie about remembering someone’s sacrifice forever?</p>
<p>Death for no reason,</p>
<p>is a part of war.</p>
<p>We need to value veterans enough,</p>
<p>to not lie to people who are thinking of joining the military,</p>
<p>and to encourage their children,</p>
<p>to think hard about the risks,</p>
<p>and to find other opportunities,</p>
<p>like rich people almost always do.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>I am grateful for my freedom to think and write what I wish on this
website,</p>
<p>and speak my mind in public.</p>
<p>And I understand the cost.</p>
<p>This is why I decided early that I would never serve in the
military.</p>
<p>And why I am unwilling to join in on the rituals.</p>
<p>I value the holiday,</p>
<p>and my freedom to think,</p>
<p>how I want to about it.</p>
<p>Thank you Veterans for this freedom.</p>

<p>Life is still beautiful in many ways,</p>
<p>even if you refrain from exclaiming</p>
<p>“Brilliant”</p>
<p>after experiencing anything you like,</p>
<p>or pretend to like.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Actually,</p>
<p>life doesn’t change much,</p>
<p>when you stop speaking.</p>
<p>Your culture convinces you,</p>
<p>that you need to use these superlatives,</p>
<p>all the time,</p>
<p>to have any enthusiasm at all,</p>
<p>especially as you get older.</p>
<p>Old people are constantly admiring,</p>
<p>excessively,</p>
<p>because they have less feeling</p>
<p>to begin with.</p>
<p>Thus everything becomes “brilliant”</p>
<p>when very little seems</p>
<p>brilliant</p>
<p>any longer.</p>
<p>Kids have enthusiasm,</p>
<p>without any need</p>
<p>to rely on these words,</p>
<p>or any words at all,</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Old people,</p>
<p>are frequently guided by</p>
<p>their own act. …</p>
<p>This was a positive post.</p>
<p>Can you tell me why?</p>
<p>Can you then tell me why,</p>
<p>you could also see it as a negative post?</p>
<p>Then can you tell me why,</p>
<p>it was neither?</p>
<p>You will learn to think how I think,</p>
<p>using this exercise.</p>
<p>You cannot simply choose,</p>
<p>it to be a negative post,</p>
<p>based on your reaction to it.</p>
<p>Or a positive one,</p>
<p>if you like it.</p>

<h2
id="quotes-that-are-really-old-part-i."><a name="quotes-that-are-really-old-one">Quotes
that are really old, Part I.</a></h2>
<p>Sometimes I am shocked just how old certain quotes are. I once
encountered a quote in Plutarch (from the second century AD), that had a
modern feel, that Plutarch said was at least another thousand years old
(or something to that same effect). I do not recall this quote off
hand.</p>
<p>Just today I encountered a quote I use regularly, mainly to amuse
myself:</p>
<p>“Birds of a feather flock together.”</p>
<p>I found this quote in Aristotle’s <em>Art of Rhetoric</em>, written
roughly 2300 years ago. (Henderson, p. 127, 2000).</p>
<p>He used it as if it were as well-known as it is today, indicating it
could be much much older.</p>
<p>Not only is it interesting that it is old,</p>
<p>but that many,</p>
<p>particularly Christians,</p>
<p>might be surprised to find our culture has descended from</p>
<p>Greeks and other cultures,</p>
<p>and from Philosophers,</p>
<p>like Aristotle,</p>
<p>and not merely those sources they would assume</p>
<p>or expect.</p>
<p>Cultures overlap significantly.</p>
<p>Not only in their current expression,</p>
<p>but in their sources.</p>

don’t like what you said therefore I can do anything I want to you.”
Part II.</a></h2>
<p>Previously I stated the fact that people tend to think that their
feelings</p>
<p>amount to rough equivalents</p>
<p>for valid inferences.</p>
<p>If you do X, I feel Y, and I react R, given Y.</p>
<p>I do not concern myself if my feelings or my reactions to my
feelings,</p>
<p>involve a valid chain of inferences</p>
<p>from X.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>This is not a logical progression,</p>
<p>and we end up with:</p>
<p>“I don’t like what you said and therefore I can do anything I want to
you.”</p>
<p>Just a moment ago,</p>
<p>as I was reading Aristotle’s</p>
<p><em>Art of Rhetoric</em>,</p>
<p>I stumbled upon a proverb he quoted,</p>
<p>that said</p>
<p>“Evil doing only needs an excuse.” (Henderson, p. 135, 2000).</p>
<p>That such a phrase is over 2300 years old,</p>
<p>to me verifies my position,</p>
<p>but from an alternative perspective.</p>
<p>Some are on the precipice of committing evil acts,</p>
<p>and only wait</p>
<p>for something they can use</p>
<p>as a catalyst.</p>
<p>That catalyst can be something as simple as,</p>
<p>a verbal slight…</p>
<p>or less than that,</p>
<p>something said,</p>
<p>that can be taken the wrong way,</p>
<p>or twisted to be something</p>
<p>publicly offense worthy.</p>
<p>Feelings are not inferences.</p>
<p>So unfortunately,</p>
<p>all it takes to become a victim,</p>
<p>is to first say something, such that a feeling</p>
<p>is aroused in another</p>
<p>that is mistaken for a valid inference</p>
<p>from that statement</p>
<p>and then used as a mere excuse</p>
<p>for some greater and disproportionate reaction.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The causal chain is as follows:</p>
<p>Statement made &gt;</p>
<p>Feeling aroused &gt;</p>
<p>Feeling mistaken for an inference &gt;</p>
<p>Amplified retaliation planned or performed &gt;</p>
<p>excuse and retaliation is rationalized</p>
<p>(The use of the feeble excuse is excused).</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Mistakes made are threefold:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A feeling aroused is simply not an inference from what caused
it.</li>
<li>Retaliation planned or performed is disproportionate and may not be
required at all.</li>
<li>Retaliation is due inability to cope with the feeling, not due to
logic.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="fact-people."><a name="fact-people">Fact People.</a></h2>
<p>When I was young, I was a typical “know it all”.</p>
<p>Facts were plentiful.</p>
<p>I was very curious and wanted to express what I knew,</p>
<p>when I knew something.</p>
<p>It is one way that people,</p>
<p>indicate to other people,</p>
<p>that they are smart.</p>
<p>But now I realize this is actually</p>
<p>a mistaken way to appraise someone,</p>
<p>and fools capitalize on it,</p>
<p>by spitting out supposed facts.</p>
<p>And then later,</p>
<p>fools try to measure people,</p>
<p>by their ability to spit out facts,</p>
<p>but the problem is,</p>
<p>every person on earth has access to what</p>
<p>they think are facts.</p>
<p>So it amounts to</p>
<p>How much you talk,</p>
<p>and say what is</p>
<p><em>traditionally accepted</em></p>
<p>as a truth.</p>
<p>So all you have to do,</p>
<p>is remember things that seem like</p>
<p>facts to everyone else.</p>
<p>This is what the mansplainers do.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>There are very smart people with powerful memories,</p>
<p>and in a sense,</p>
<p>this is <em>a</em> mark of the intelligent person,</p>
<p>but everyone can remember facts,</p>
<p>and most can talk fast.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>But now I see,</p>
<p>from tons of experience,</p>
<p>that fact spitting,</p>
<p>is just remembering.</p>
<p>It isn’t thinking at all.</p>
<p>So now, what I value,</p>
<p>is the strategic thinker.</p>
<p>The person with many tools,</p>
<p>that apply to any question</p>
<p>that might crop up.</p>
<p>The person who has gotten</p>
<p><em>past</em></p>
<p>factiness</p>
<p>and realizes,</p>
<p>that almost everything is complex,</p>
<p>and that</p>
<p>very often,</p>
<p>the “facts”</p>
<p>that others have</p>
<p>simply are not facts.</p>
<p>They are truthy thoughts,</p>
<p>with many errors built in.</p>
<p>And when this is not the case,</p>
<p>and H<sub>2</sub>0 is water,</p>
<p>there is a feeling that</p>
<p>everyone knows that,</p>
<p>or that one can look it up,</p>
<p>like a Chemist does,</p>
<p>when it is not</p>
<p>H<sub>2</sub>0.</p>
<p>(They remember more than this obviously, but I find it humorous for
the moment.)</p>
<p>[Aside: Smart people offload facts to books, and value knowing how to
find facts. To give you an example, I used to own many books. I am fond
of libraries. The reason I really liked books, especially books I was
exposed to or have read, wasn’t that I memorized everything contained,
but that they were extensions of my mind, such that I could access the
information again if necessary. It is nicer to be able to instantly
recall certain facts, but the mind is not limitless. So we have to
choose what is worth remembering, and what is worth accessing via our
fingertips, from knowing where to look.]</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>What we end up with in the end,</p>
<p>are rankers.</p>
<p>Everyday people,</p>
<p>posturing,</p>
<p>as Fact People.</p>
<p>Testing people,</p>
<p>for facts,</p>
<p>without understanding,</p>
<p>how much more complex it really is,</p>
<p>to test someone</p>
<p>for what they know,</p>
<p>and what they can do.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The effect is that leaders posture</p>
<p>by holding a stack of books.</p>
<p>Bill Gates currently.</p>
<p>I held the stack of books,</p>
<p>and I can tell you,</p>
<p>it is largely B.S.</p>
<p>A stack of books,</p>
<p>does not mean you remember the facts contained,</p>
<p>or that you really read them,</p>
<p>or that it is worth your time</p>
<p>to read them.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Effective people,</p>
<p>know how to form a problem first,</p>
<p>find what they need,</p>
<p>problem solve with an assortment of tools,</p>
<p>and <em>offload unimportant facts</em></p>
<p>even when curiosity creates a desire</p>
<p>for those facts.</p>
<p>This does not mean they do not also read for leisure,</p>
<p>but it means,</p>
<p>they know the difference.</p>
<p>Other people don’t know the difference.</p>
<p>And guess what.</p>
<p>Gates knows the difference.</p>
<p>But he will market himself,</p>
<p>as the guy who holds the stack of books,</p>
<p>because you might not</p>
<p>know the difference.</p>
<p>He understands</p>
<p>“Fact People”.</p>
<p>But he is a thinking person.</p>

<li>I know something.</li>
<li>It is stored in my brain.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now let us consider,</p>
<p>that for anything that we have stored in our brain,</p>
<p>enabling us to say we know something,</p>
<p>such that we would understand it when someone says it to us,</p>
<p>means there is always a chance,</p>
<p>That I would <em>think</em> of it…</p>
<p>And if I would think of it,</p>
<p>on occasion,</p>
<p>perhaps,</p>
<p>[Aside: probably I would think of it eventually, and maybe not at the
best time.]</p>
<p>I might speak of it…</p>
<p>or say it…</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>For these reasons we should permit,</p>
<p>lapses in political correctness,</p>
<p>from almost anyone,</p>
<p>so long as they would not commit,</p>
<p>necessarily,</p>
<p>to the negative aspect of what it is,</p>
<p>we are wanting people to not think.</p>
<p>[Aside: There are dangers in even wanting this unless there is a
really good process for doing it. “Public Opinion” is not a
process.]</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>There is an odd thing here,</p>
<p>that to really eliminate usage,</p>
<p>we have to unlearn it.</p>
<p>The proof,</p>
<p>is that we try to keep children,</p>
<p>from learning curse words,</p>
<p>because of course,</p>
<p>what goes in,</p>
<p>comes back out again.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Our elders,</p>
<p>can be expected to say things,</p>
<p>we would not necessarily like,</p>
<p>because they have them stored.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Fault people for their storage?</p>
<p>This is faulting people for knowledge.</p>
<p>There is no unlearning.</p>
<p>Fault people for not unlearning?</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>A weird thing about this,</p>
<p>is that it is lost to history,</p>
<p>if it is unremembered.</p>
<p>Because even to read history,</p>
<p>if it were written about,</p>
<p>means to learn it again.</p>
<p>(And therefore it is no longer unremembered then).</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>These and other uncomfortable truths,</p>
<p>indicate that we are quite lost,</p>
<p>when we are so harsh in our judgements of</p>
<p>what people say,</p>
<p>apart from,</p>
<p>the content and meaning they</p>
<p>would commit to.</p>

Winter Holiday Season May be Simply for Tolerating the Winter.</a></h2>
<p>Consider that we have a very prolonged sense of holiday,</p>
<p>and winter festivities,</p>
<p>crossing over months of cold.</p>
<p>If we did not have any holidays at this time,</p>
<p>how would we feel.</p>
<p>Consider also, that Christmas,</p>
<p>Yule, Thanksgiving,</p>
<p>and so forth,</p>
<p>are holidays for those living in</p>
<p>colder climates, and not warmer ones.</p>
<p>Further consider,</p>
<p>that much of the celebration,</p>
<p>involves celebrating surpluses,</p>
<p>of work from earlier months.</p>
<p>Meaning we are to be happy,</p>
<p>for having enough “extras”</p>
<p>to live through the winter,</p>
<p>without much effort,</p>
<p>and with enough,</p>
<p>to fatten ourselves easily.</p>
<p>We stay warm with our fires,</p>
<p>we eat more than necessary,</p>
<p>and the holiday cuisine,</p>
<p>is comfort food,</p>
<p>and items we would hardly want to eat,</p>
<p>in the summer time,</p>
<p>or in a desert environment.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>It is my opinion,</p>
<p>that it is highly likely,</p>
<p>that we would have a winter holiday,</p>
<p>no matter what our cultural heritage was,</p>
<p>and no matter what our religious commitments might be,</p>
<p>if we have to endure,</p>
<p>a long winter,</p>
<p>where we reside.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>For this reason,</p>
<p>I think,</p>
<p>Christians and others,</p>
<p>claimed Christmas.</p>
<p>We do know,</p>
<p>that Christmas was claimed.</p>
<p>It has nothing to do with any birth date</p>
<p>on record.</p>
<p>It has to do,</p>
<p>with the onset of winter,</p>
<p>when it was already cold,</p>
<p>and there were months of cold remaining.</p>
<p>December 25<sup>th</sup>,</p>
<p>is not far off from,</p>
<p>December 21st.</p>
<p>I think it is good timing,</p>
<p>for such festivities.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>I’m not a Christian,</p>
<p>(and I’m part Christian too</p>
<p>although that’s best explained</p>
<p>at another time),</p>
<p>but I do like the fall and winter holidays.</p>

Start Means Started from Behind</a></h2>
<p>Some might think this sounds rude to say.</p>
<p>But let me tell you,</p>
<p><em>permanently disadvantaged people</em></p>
<p>are convinced later,</p>
<p>by tricky people,</p>
<p>wanting to preserve their own merits,</p>
<p>that really</p>
<p>the disadvantaged people received all they needed,</p>
<p>because in fact, they got a “head start”.</p>
<p>We open ourselves up to these games,</p>
<p>by not being totally honest with ourselves.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The euphemism can be flipped,</p>
<p>to be used against you,</p>
<p>and not used,</p>
<p>simply to prevent you from being stigmatized.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>So it is much better to</p>
<p>get real,</p>
<p>and say that Head Start,</p>
<p>is well,</p>
<p>something different.</p>
<p>I’m not sure what is best to call it.</p>
<p>But it is certainly there,</p>
<p>for those who have limitations.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Why not address the limitations,</p>
<p>at the core.</p>
<p>It’s because of parental issues,</p>
<p>economic issues,</p>
<p>and lack of inheritance.</p>
<p>“I inherited no possessions,</p>
<p>no wealth,</p>
<p>no knowledge,</p>
<p>and parents who are</p>
<p>of lower quality,</p>
<p>or parents,</p>

<p>That rich children,</p>
<p>somehow merited</p>
<p>their head start.</p>
<p>We know what a head start is,</p>
<p>and we don’t.</p>
<p>We name a program,</p>
<p>for giving kids a better chance,</p>
<p>head-start,</p>
<p>to cover up,</p>
<p>the fact that they are starting,</p>
<p>from behind,</p>
<p>and will likely remain behind,</p>
<p>even with the additional education.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The way it works currently,</p>
<p>is</p>
<p>rich children get old enough,</p>
<p>to rely on memory loss,</p>
<p>to recreate their history,</p>
<p>such that only those accomplishments,</p>
<p>coming <em>after</em> High School or College,</p>
<p>when they are totally alone,</p>
<p>count.</p>
<p>“My parents did nothing for me.”</p>
<p>“Nothing at all depended on my parents, grandparents or family.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“I remember everything I did,</p>
<p>in a way that is disconnected,</p>
<p>from everything I received.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>One of the reasons we want to leave money for our children,</p>
<p>is because we think</p>
<p><em>they will <strong>NOT</strong> succeed without it</em>.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“All families are equal”</p>
<p>so why not leave fortunes,</p>
<p>to children from other families?</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Before I focused on how,</p>
<p>we don’t believe in equality,</p>
<p>because we are unable to trust in the</p>
<p>interchangeability of adults,</p>
<p>in our guidance.</p>
<p>But we can switch the direction.</p>
<p>If all children are equal,</p>
<p>(which is closer to truth, although still false),</p>
<p>then why not,</p>
<p>leave your money to someone,</p>
<p>who is not your child.</p>
<p>….</p>
<p>Because if all people are equal,</p>
<p>why not give them equal access,</p>

often means “I don’t plan on doing anything”.</a></h2>
<p>I don’t mean it never makes sense to feel grateful.</p>
<p>It means we should recognize,</p>
<p>when being grateful means</p>
<p>“I’m rationalizing feeling good about something I don’t intend to
ever improve.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>I’m not fond of examples, because they are plentiful.</p>
<p>Nevertheless to give one example,</p>
<p>The meat-eater,</p>
<p>eats over the carcass of a Thanksgiving turkey,</p>
<p>saying how grateful they are,</p>
<p>for the turkey,</p>
<p>but in deed they don’t care at all</p>
<p>where it came from,</p>
<p>how it died,</p>
<p>or how it lived,</p>
<p>and they never plan to care,</p>
<p>ever.</p>
<p>This is the kind of “grateful” I find abhorrent.</p>
<p>Because it conceals apathy,</p>
<p>and if it were pointed out,</p>
<p>hate for better ways would emerge.</p>
<p>So what is more likely,</p>
<p>is that this is a ritual,</p>
<p>like burning a sacrifice,</p>
<p>than any actual instance of being,</p>
<p>truly grateful.</p>
<p>It is unreflective,</p>
<p>and automatic,</p>
<p>tradition keeping.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Nevertheless,</p>
<p>I do think at the dinner table,</p>
<p>with the turkey at the centerpiece,</p>
<p>there is plenty to feel grateful for,</p>
<p>like family,</p>
<p>health, and friendship.</p>
<p>But notice this is mostly,</p>
<p>acknowledgement of what one has,</p>
<p>and not what one plans to do.</p>
<p>And sometimes,</p>
<p>what one decidedly plans to avoid doing.</p>
<p>“I am thankful for this kill,</p>
<p>and this alone makes it OK,</p>
<p>and satisfies the requirements,</p>
<p>for continuing to take animals.”</p>
<p>People think this,</p>
<p>because they care about animals,</p>
<p>truly,</p>
<p>but also plan,</p>
<p>to change nothing,</p>
<p>even when options become available…</p>

handwriting, and hand-markings.</a></h2>
<p>I’ve been receiving letters of recommendation from colleagues,
partners and clients over the last week. There is something special
about seeing someone’s signature in their own handwriting. I wonder to
myself, how may people, worry about showing their handwriting to others.
It would make very little difference to me what the signatures look
like. What makes the difference is that it came directly from someone’s
hands. This is not just nostalgia for a time when people did things
without computers, although some nostalgia is intermixed too.</p>
<p>A friend on Facebook was posting petroglyphs recently. The
petroglyphs were not remarkably beautiful. In fact, they looked the same
as many petroglyphs over the globe tend to look.</p>
<p>Signatures and petroglyphs both evoke the “someone with a hand like
mine touched this differently” feeling. It says “this other person is
real” in a sense.</p>
<p>Is this an unnamed feeling in English?</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>I don’t think this feeling means, we ought to return to
petroglyphs.</p>
<p>Or even cursive.</p>
<p>Because I should recognize that the writing itself bears the mark of
the mind of the person who wrote it too, more significantly than the
markings.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is where I should notice, that there is more
sentimentality in the experience, than I first recognized.</p>

don’t reject what doesn’t exist.</a></h2>
<p>I’ll explain this one briefly.</p>
<p>Imagine someone offers you a gift.</p>
<p>They hold out their hands, and tell you they are giving you a box,
wrapped up with a bow on it.</p>
<p>But they are just holding out their hands, and there is nothing
there.</p>
<p>Are you rejecting the gift, if you cannot receive it?</p>
<p>Is there even a gift?</p>
<p>If you say you don’t want “it”,</p>
<p>you still are <em>not</em> rejecting the gift,</p>
<p>because there is no corresponding object satisfying the sentence.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Let’s put it another way.</p>
<p>A child presents you with their imaginary friend.</p>
<p>They tell you that their imaginary friend needs a job from you.</p>
<p>(You don’t need anything).</p>
<p>The child gives you an imaginary resume and job application too.</p>
<p>Do you reject the job application,</p>
<p>or do you simply understand that there isn’t one?</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Why did I use a child for the above scenario?</p>
<p>When I’m presented with an imaginary friend,</p>
<p>of adults,</p>
<p>I usually get the feeling,</p>
<p>that they are children in a way.</p>
<p>And I don’t need anything,</p>
<p>yet they tell me I do,</p>
<p>and they give me an ancient text,</p>
<p>that is a resume of sorts,</p>
<p>that I don’t really feel,</p>
<p>matches the format of a real resume,</p>
<p>that would include facts,</p>
<p>about living,</p>
<p>existing people.</p>
<p>And if they can’t make sense,</p>
<p>how much does it really matter,</p>

<p>“Problem solutions”.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The quote simply is untenable.</p>
<p>The reason is there is always a game-theoretic</p>
<p>rationale,</p>
<p>for choosing to maintain something,</p>
<p>or to not maintain something,</p>
<p>with many possible ways of doing the maintaining,</p>
<p>and many possible outcomes to compare,</p>
<p>for any given scenario.</p>
<p>Meaning, the choice isn’t to simply leave things as they are</p>
<p>by default.</p>
<p>What about replacement?</p>
<p>So really, what you should do,</p>
<p>is list the options,</p>
<p>consider the energy you need to put into the solution,</p>
<p>compare solutions,</p>
<p>compare risks,</p>
<p>then make a choice.</p>
<p>Sometimes that choice is to fix something,</p>
<p>that will soon be broken.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Very few proverbs such as this,</p>
<p>suffer from no serious defects.</p>
<p>This proverb,</p>
<p>has sent millions into the land,</p>

<p>to begin to identify,</p>
<p>which other stories appear to be</p>
<p>true or false,</p>
<p>or how “truthy” or</p>
<p>“falsey”</p>
<p>they appear to be.</p>
<p>(Since entire books are not either true or false,</p>
<p>but admit of degrees of truth or falsity,</p>
<p>and quantity of truths and untruths to be found.)</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Why do I know this?</p>
<p>We already do it with more complex things,</p>
<p>first of all.</p>
<p>Second of all,</p>
<p>if we do really long expansions</p>
<p>of my <a href="lists.html">Lists</a>,</p>
<p>that were designed to allow us to instantly</p>
<p>cast aside obvious falsities from our lives,</p>
<p>we would find that these</p>
<p>falsities</p>
<p>occur frequently in works of fiction,</p>
<p>but less frequently,</p>
<p>in works of truth,</p>
<p>in total,</p>
<p>and on average.</p>
<p>By determining, the degree to which,</p>
<p>these fictions,</p>
<p>figure into the story,</p>
<p>we should be able to flag certain works,</p>
<p>as being suspect.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>In the future,</p>
<p>we can go beyond this simple method,</p>
<p>and we will start to get a clearer picture,</p>
<p>of which stories approximate those</p>
<p>that seem to have high veracity,</p>
<p>to those with low veracity.</p>
<p>Low veracity works,</p>
<p>I expect,</p>
<p>will be like the religious cosmologies,</p>
<p>other stories of mythology,</p>
<p>prognostications and prophesies of religion,</p>
<p>and obvious fictions written</p>
<p>without any intention,</p>
<p>that the works would be taken</p>
<p>for literal truth,</p>
<p>that are more for entertainment.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>More importantly,</p>
<p>we already know,</p>
<p>which stories are both</p>
<p>important and</p>
<p>would fail this kind of test.</p>
<p>Some of us,</p>
<p>just won’t admit it,</p>
<p>until AI tells us,</p>
<p>we were wrong to pretend.</p>

<h2 id="just-saying-smartness"><a name="just-saying-smartness">Just
Saying “Smartness”</a></h2>
<p>Use of the word “retarded” is considered rude.</p>
<p>At one time it was just fine, when it was fitting.</p>
<p>We were fine with calling a handicapped person who is less
intelligent,</p>
<p>“Retarded”</p>
<p>which meant roughly,</p>
<p>less intelligent,</p>
<p>but was more specific than that.</p>
<p>But we do not like its use now,</p>
<p>because the way we use it attacks people,</p>
<p>for things they cannot change,</p>
<p>and thus it would cause long lasting</p>
<p>harm to make fun of them this way.</p>
<p>But I find our distaste for using “retard” to contradict,</p>
<p>our readiness to use “stupid”.</p>
<p>Not only when it is apt,</p>
<p>and therefore,</p>
<p>involves an unchangeable aspect of a person,</p>
<p>but also,</p>
<p>because we’ll use it when a person</p>
<p>certainly is not stupid.</p>
<p>We’re ready to call everyone stupid.</p>
<p>to the effect,</p>
<p>that smart people wonder</p>
<p>about themselves unnecessarily.</p>
<p>This is how we previously used “retard”.</p>
<p>All we are doing now</p>
<p>is substituting a term,</p>
<p>that should be nearly as offensive.</p>
<p>It’s only because</p>
<p>“retarded” brings to mind the handicapped</p>
<p>that we feel the way we do about it.</p>
<p>But how do you feel about calling someone</p>
<p>who is really slow “stupid” really?</p>
<p>Someone who is also really kind,</p>
<p>and peaceful, for example.</p>
<p>I would argue,</p>
<p>that “stupid” is far more harmful,</p>
<p>because a very large portion of the population,</p>
<p>is not incredibly smart,</p>
<p>and depending on who you are,</p>
<p>many other people could be called stupid,</p>
<p>by comparison.</p>
<p>Meanwhile,</p>
<p>some handicapped people would really</p>
<p>need to be trained</p>
<p>to even understand what retard</p>
<p>actually means,</p>
<p>and therefore,</p>
<p>cannot be offended,</p>
<p>without your help.</p>
<p>And if they are not offended,</p>
<p>then what is the problem?</p>
<p>Then it is more about</p>
<p>parents and caretakers</p>
<p>and not the handicapped people.</p>
<p>Nevertheless,</p>
<p>I am not arguing,</p>
<p>that we should return to use</p>
<p>“retarded” again.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>We struggle with this,</p>
<p>but really the solution is simple in this case.</p>
<p>When we say someone is retarded, or stupid, or slow,</p>
<p>we merely mean they have a level of smartness,</p>
<p>that is lower than some arbitrary reference point.</p>
<p>Meaning, we compare people,</p>
<p>when we say “stupid”</p>
<p>to either average people,</p>
<p>or to really smart people.</p>
<p>Either way, it is arbitrary.</p>
<p>I would argue,</p>
<p>that we should compare ourselves with the next</p>
<p>smartest animal instead.</p>
<p>Let us admit that Chimpanzees are very smart animals,</p>
<p>but their smartness is lower than our own.</p>
<p>Almost all people</p>
<p>are smarter in the ways we think about</p>
<p>when we say “smart”,</p>
<p>than Chimpanzees.</p>
<p>[Aside: Not everyone.. but that is OK. But also notice, Chimpanzees
are <em>smarter than us</em> in some ways, just not the ways we normally
recognize as smarts (IQ for example).]</p>
<p>Now,</p>
<p>this means that,</p>
<p>everyone is smart.</p>
<p>Now if you are average,</p>
<p>why don’t you recognize</p>
<p>how smart you are compared to all</p>
<p>dead matter in the universe?</p>
<p>The next smartest animal,</p>
<p>is nowhere near as smart as you.</p>
<p>Most smart<em>er</em> people, are really probably smarter than
you,</p>
<p>in a lot of ways,</p>
<p>but not necessarily all ways</p>
<p>although some very smart people,</p>
<p>may be smarter than you in nearly</p>
<p>all ways.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean,</p>
<p>you don’t have strengths they aren’t lacking.</p>
<p>[Aside: Although we shouldn’t strain to hard to equalize people,
since some people simply are very magnificent examples of people].</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Now, what is the point?</p>
<p>We don’t call anyone “stupid”.</p>
<p>We don’t call anyone “retarded”.</p>
<p>We don’t call anyone “moron”.</p>
<p>We have to be</p>
<p><em>more specific</em></p>
<p>from now on.</p>
<p>It is OK to speak about someone’s</p>
<p><em>level</em></p>
<p>of smartness on a scale,</p>
<p>when that is relevant.</p>
<p>Even if that is awkward,</p>
<p>or harshly truthful.</p>
<p>Sometimes that is necessary.</p>
<p>But this doesn’t</p>
<p>devalue anyone completely.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>But notice,</p>
<p>that if you do this,</p>
<p>you are becoming a “<a
href="christopher-matthew-cavanaugh-thoughtstream.html#beware-of-the-ranker">ranker</a>”</p>
<p>in that you think you can</p>
<p>mark where someone falls on a scale,</p>
<p>without doing any measurements,</p>
<p>and it is possible that others</p>
<p>can abuse this,</p>
<p>as I’ve said earlier in</p>
<p>the ThoughtStream</p>
<p><a
href="christopher-matthew-cavanaugh-thoughtstream.html#beware-of-the-ranker">Beware
of the Rankers</a></p>
<p>And if you try to do this,</p>
<p>you are still summing up</p>
<p>someone’s mind completely,</p>
<p>so it is an over-generalization</p>
<p>as well.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>How do we correct that?</p>
<p>My thought is,</p>
<p>start thinking in terms of a scale,</p>
<p>from smart to very smart,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Aside: Not “smartest”. That will cause problems. See <a
href="christopher-matthew-cavanaugh-thoughtstream.html#estest">EstEst</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>or from lower in smartness to higher in smartness,</p>
<p>It will be <em>hard</em> to make that change.</p>
<p>Everyone else will have to work on changing it</p>
<p>also for it to be really successful.</p>
<p>I still stay “stupid”,</p>
<p>and there is a post here in the ThoughtStream that uses the word
also.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Aside: Although the point I’m making there, is not lost by using
this unfortunate term. (See <a
href="christopher-matthew-cavanaugh-thoughtstream.html#the-lady-who-cried-ad-hominem">The
Lady Who Cried Ad Hominem</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>…</p>
<p>But after this stage, we can get better.</p>
<p>Even if everyone else fails to improve,</p>
<p>it might be worthwhile to take the steps independently,</p>
<p>anyhow.</p>
<p>Why not get even more specific:</p>
<p>“You don’t seem to be doing X correctly.”</p>
<p>“After watching you, I think maybe, you don’t have an aptitude for
this.”</p>
<p>“You could have done that in a smarter way.”</p>
<p>“Your IQ test indicated you are high on smartness in visual tasks,
but is lower on verbal tasks”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>So in the end,</p>
<p>what we end up doing,</p>
<p>is moving from using very short sentences like:</p>
<p>“You are stupid”</p>
<p>that claims way too much about a person,</p>
<p>to longer sentences,</p>
<p>that say less about someone,</p>
<p>but are more specific,</p>
<p>more truthful,</p>
<p>and more kind.</p>

Authentic, but that’s Unbecoming.</a></h2>
<p>“That’s unbecoming of a gentleman.”</p>
<p>“That’s unbecoming of a rapper.”</p>
<p>If you’re an elite figure, you’re expected to display certain
traits,</p>
<p>have certain interests,</p>
<p>engage in certain behaviors,</p>
<p>to the exclusion,</p>
<p>of many other behaviors.</p>
<p>You end up,</p>
<p>ignoring various things you like,</p>
<p>diverse activities you might want to do,</p>
<p>to achieve an image of sorts.</p>
<p>This to me is not authenticity.</p>
<p>It’s not complete inauthenticity either though.</p>
<p>You have to make choices.</p>
<p>Authenticity on a scale?</p>
<p>Authenticity does not matter so much?</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Pretty much everyone you can find,</p>
<p>will have diverse interests,</p>
<p>that cross outside of what is prescribed,</p>
<p>by some definition,</p>
<p>or expectation,</p>
<p>of authenticity.</p>
<p>I think the eclectic personality,</p>
<p>is too hard for people to sum up,</p>
<p>with the effect that,</p>
<p>inauthenticity is assumed,</p>
<p>when someone has too many interests,</p>
<p>or too many personas.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>I’m inclined to think,</p>
<p>that a complete expression of self,</p>
<p>in all guises,</p>
<p>is closer to high authenticity,</p>
<p>on a spectrum,</p>
<p>than any attempt,</p>
<p>to fit into some specific image.</p>
<p>But I hesitate though,</p>
<p>because it’s authentic,</p>
<p>to want to give up aspects of self,</p>
<p>to become something new,</p>
<p>that is maybe</p>
<p>something less eclectic.</p>
<p>And so I find myself,</p>
<p>questioning the value of</p>
<p>the idea of authenticity.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>An inauthentic person,</p>
<p>is sometimes merely a beginner.</p>
<p>“That person is fake.”</p>
<p>Maybe that person,</p>
<p>is trying to be like you,</p>
<p>and therefore is more like you,</p>
<p>than you think.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Even the rapper,</p>
<p>started out a kid,</p>
<p>who somehow started acting like</p>
<p>a rapper.</p>
<p>If placed in Saudi Arabia,</p>
<p>that kid would start acting,</p>
<p>Saudi Arabian.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>People can be authentic,</p>
<p>and be</p>
<p>seemingly something completely different</p>
<p>at different times.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Anyone could take violin lessons,</p>
<p>in their free time.</p>
<p>How would you be</p>
<p>during your violin lessons?</p>

Heart is a Blood-pumping Organ.</a></h2>
<p>In my <a href="lists.html">lists</a> page,</p>
<p>I discussed an issue with metaphors.</p>
<p>Metaphors are when you say figuratively,</p>
<p>that one thing is another.</p>
<p>Similes by contrast,</p>
<p>are when you say that one thing</p>
<p>is <em>like</em> another.</p>
<p>I claimed that the identification,</p>
<p>of one thing with another,</p>
<p>using metaphors,</p>
<p>causes confusion.</p>
<p>Here is an example.</p>
<p>What does it mean,</p>
<p>to say you have</p>
<p>“heart”?</p>
<p>I find it highly likely,</p>
<p>that if we trace the etymology,</p>
<p>of various words like heart,</p>
<p>used for things other than</p>
<p>blood-pumping organs,</p>
<p>we will locate metaphors,</p>
<p>that resulted in confusions.</p>
<p>After the original confusions,</p>
<p>people who are</p>
<p>beguiled by the beauty of the</p>
<p>works of literature,</p>
<p>making such comparisons,</p>
<p>people begin to say,</p>
<p>for example,</p>
<p>“heart”</p>
<p>instead of,</p>
<p>“perseverance”.</p>
<p>Now,</p>
<p>“heart” means all sorts of things,</p>
<p>that are quite confusing,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>people will symbolically use</p>
<p>the symbol</p>
<p>representing the blood-pumping organ,</p>
<p>that also represents</p>
<p><em>love.</em></p>
<p>Good dictionaries,</p>
<p>like the Oxford English Dictionary,</p>
<p>that I have ready at hand,</p>
<p>determine the meanings of words,</p>
<p>by usage,</p>
<p>and trace the history,</p>
<p>back to examples of popular works,</p>
<p>of authors,</p>
<p>who used words in the ways,</p>
<p>indicated in the definitions.</p>
<p>The OED is a trusted</p>
<p>authority in such matters.</p>
<p>I consider it to be a certainty,</p>
<p>that such words will be found,</p>
<p>in the OED,</p>
<p>within initial metaphorical uses,</p>
<p>at least in secondary definitions,</p>
<p>and those created later,</p>
<p>and these uses</p>
<p>resulted in the confusions</p>
<p>that now exist.</p>
<p>And now we have</p>
<p>“hearts”</p>
<p>that have nothing to do at all</p>
<p>with hearts.</p>
<p>And we have a symbol,</p>
<p>that confounds the two.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Now,</p>
<p>how inseparable do they seem?</p>
<p>Love and heart.</p>
<p>Perseverance and heart.</p>
<p>Perseverance and love?</p>
<p>These concepts,</p>
<p>have very little to do</p>
<p>with each other.</p>
<p>Why not,</p>
<p>Perseverance and Brain? Heart and Brain? Love and Brain?</p>
<p>Another source of the error</p>
<p>is old folk-biology.</p>
<p>Because even the literature,</p>
<p>gets its inspiration,</p>
<p>from someplace.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>As I said in my <a href="lists.html">Lists</a> page,</p>
<p>I do not want to constrain literature,</p>
<p>but rather,</p>
<p>I want people to be aware,</p>
<p>that this is how confusions are created,</p>
<p>so that people,</p>
<p>become good at detecting,</p>
<p>issues,</p>
<p>that go unrecognized,</p>
<p>in heart symbols,</p>
<p>to take one example.</p>

having a better way to say it.</a></h2>
<p>Much of what we say,</p>
<p>is insufficient, inaccurate, or false.</p>
<p>Take “perfect”</p>
<p>for example.</p>
<p>When we use this word,</p>
<p>we are not being accurate.</p>
<p>It is insufficient, and usually false.</p>
<p>Why do we continue to say it?</p>
<p>Well,</p>
<p>because we are imperfect,</p>
<p>at being accurate.</p>
<p>But also because we</p>
<p>do not have anything better to say,</p>
<p>at the time we are motivated to say it.</p>
<p>Perfection is relative.</p>
<p>Not only is it relative,</p>
<p>it is criteria based,</p>
<p>when it is accurate.</p>
<p>There are other issues with the word,</p>
<p>besides this.</p>
<p>The most important objection though,</p>
<p>is that we don’t really know,</p>
<p>what we are saying,</p>
<p>when we are saying it.</p>
<p>When someone says:</p>
<p>“That work of art is perfect.”</p>
<p>Ask them:</p>
<p>“According to what criteria?”</p>
<p>And you will find,</p>
<p>they simply mean,</p>
<p>“I like it a lot.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>We need to find,</p>
<p>a way to express our experiences,</p>
<p>such that,</p>
<p>we are not chronically</p>
<p>over-exaggerating.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>One such way,</p>
<p>is to stick to descriptions.</p>
<p>“I like this moment because… x, y, z.”</p>
<p>To this you might object:</p>
<p>“But there is not enough time to get it right.”</p>
<p>At that moment,</p>
<p>I’ll point you to this thoughtstream.</p>
<p>Notice,</p>
<p>how I care little for editing,</p>
<p>unless I find it important enough,</p>
<p>to do it later?</p>
<p>Likewise,</p>
<p>I recognize,</p>
<p>that we cannot commit to saying,</p>
<p>everything exactly right,</p>
<p>the first time,</p>
<p>in the moment.</p>
<p>And it is possible,</p>
<p>that we will never have enough time.</p>
<p>Nevertheless,</p>
<p>we have work to do,</p>
<p>to improve our language skills</p>
<p>to stop lying to ourselves.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because people think</p>
<p>Perfection is real.</p>
<p>And not merely,</p>
<p>a shortcut,</p>
<p>when there is not enough time</p>
<p>to be detailed.</p>
<p>…</p>

<h2 id="life-is-empty"><a name="life-is-empty">“Life is Empty”</a></h2>
<p>…</p>
<p>Some would say</p>
<p>“Good.</p>
<p>Finally I</p>
<p>achieved emptiness.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>I don’t think</p>
<p>“Life is Empty”</p>
<p>to myself.</p>
<p>Sometimes I wish a friend</p>
<p>or family member were present,</p>
<p>and in a sense,</p>
<p>they are not there,</p>
<p>when they are not there,</p>
<p>but I don’t think</p>
<p>“Oh no, my life is empty!”</p>
<p>This is a logical error.</p>
<p>One: Think of what emptiness really is.</p>
<p>You always have plenty of resources around you.</p>
<p>Two: You are attributing something to your entire life.</p>
<p>Nothing but life can be attributed to your entire life.</p>
<p>Once you think about it that way,</p>
<p>you can see that what is meant,</p>
<p>is something simpler:</p>
<p>“Don’t you want these things,</p>
<p>I have in mind?”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Then you get to the point.</p>
<p>People say it when they think</p>
<p>you don’t want certain particular things.</p>
<p>You don’t want family.</p>
<p>OK, so your life is lacking family.</p>
<p>That is not emptiness.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>This is how our language leads</p>
<p>us into error.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>I hear others say it.</p>
<p>I had a friend or two,</p>
<p>say it to me once.</p>
<p>He thought that if I did not have children,</p>
<p>suddenly I would find myself,</p>
<p>living an empty existence.</p>
<p>I still think that</p>
<p>is unhelpful and somewhat meaningless.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>That point of view,</p>
<p>might be more convincing,</p>
<p>to people who experience,</p>
<p>some kind of dread,</p>
<p>for not having someone,</p>
<p>and some things,</p>
<p>to distract them from</p>
<p>life.</p>
<p>It may be that those,</p>
<p>who are afraid to be alone,</p>
<p>are more likely to</p>
<p>feel this way.</p>
<p>I enjoy being alone.</p>
<p>Not always,</p>
<p>but most of the time,</p>
<p>I’m just fine.</p>
<p>When I’m less than happy,</p>
<p>it’s not due to</p>
<p>emptiness.</p>
<p>That is,</p>
<p>it’s not due to</p>
<p>not having what you want,</p>
<p>for yourself.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>In fact,</p>
<p>sometimes I chase after</p>
<p>a sort of mental emptiness.</p>
<p>The serenity of it.</p>
<p>“I want to think nothing at all now.”</p>
<p>Some Buddhists would agree.</p>
<p>Meditation,</p>
<p>done a certain way,</p>
<p>brings you to a kind of emptiness.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Aside: Not emptiness itself. I think even Buddhists are making this
error. Because they are not being specific enough, and psychologists
would probably be more quick to explain that what you are doing is not
so mysterious as Buddhists would like to think, with their posturing and
marketing. It’s kind-of amusing to think about how Buddhists posture.
Yoga right?]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>that is also,</p>
<p>clarity and contentment.</p>
<p>I think that people who</p>
<p>fill their lives,</p>
<p>with other people</p>
<p>entertainment,</p>
<p>and trinkets,</p>
<p>might benefit from</p>
<p>learning about</p>
<p>not needing or</p>
<p>wanting</p>
<p>any of these things,</p>
<p>quite so much.</p>
<p>“Give away all your possessions, now!” Right?</p>
<p>Not only were you told,</p>
<p>maybe,</p>
<p>to give everything away,</p>
<p>you’re told,</p>
<p>you need to do it now.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>What do we call</p>
<p>addiction to the presence</p>
<p>of other people?</p>
<p>What do we call</p>
<p>withdrawal symptoms,</p>
<p>from the lack of their presence?</p>
<p>Sexual addiction is one form</p>
<p>of this issue.</p>
<p>but I don’t think,</p>
<p>it is the only form.</p>
<p>Do we call it emptiness?</p>
<p>Or should we say</p>
<p>“You just don’t know how</p>
<p>to be by yourself,</p>
<p>because you’ve been around</p>
<p>others often,</p>
<p>or you simply really want</p>
<p>people to be around.</p>
<p>It’s your drug.</p>
<p>Friendship,</p>
<p>makes you feel a certain way.</p>
<p>Not everyone,</p>
<p>is into,</p>
<p>or more importantly,</p>
<p><em>addicted</em></p>
<p>to your drug.”</p>
<p>Remember that things</p>
<p>in your environment,</p>
<p>unlock drugs,</p>
<p>in your brain.</p>
<p>When these things are not present</p>
<p>any longer</p>
<p>neither are those</p>
<p>chemicals.</p>
<p>At least,</p>
<p>not in those proportions,</p>
<p>or combinations,</p>
<p>at the same times,</p>
<p>and places.</p>
<p>So when you experience,</p>
<p>“Empty nest”</p>
<p>you suddenly sit at home,</p>
<p>and that cocktail of</p>
<p>drugs</p>
<p>in your brain,</p>
<p>just is not the same</p>
<p>as it once was.</p>
<p>You also suddenly,</p>
<p>are thinking incomplete thoughts</p>
<p>about them.</p>
<p>You cannot recreate them</p>
<p>in your mind.</p>
<p>They are more real</p>
<p>than your memories</p>
<p>of them can ever be.</p>
<p>And there’s no way,</p>
<p>to get that back,</p>
<p>unless</p>
<p>they are back.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>So learn to be alone?</p>
<p>And enjoy that?</p>
<p>Because then,</p>
<p>people can come and go,</p>
<p>as you would expect,</p>
<p>over decades of your life,</p>
<p>and these people,</p>
<p>will be just fine,</p>
<p>either way.</p>
<p>They might not need you.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>They won’t tell others,</p>
<p>that the others will lead empty lives,</p>
<p>if the others don’t choose the same lives,</p>
<p>they themselves want.</p>
<p><em>But maybe that’s what you do.</em></p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Consider the solitary adventurer.</p>
<p>What solitary figures,</p>
<p>can you think of,</p>
<p>who had full lives,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Aside: It is not clear what a full life entails either.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That would depend on the person and their desires.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If they want adventure, and many experiences</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>in travel, then sure, they can fill their time with that.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>who seemed to want to be</p>
<p>alone all the time?</p>
<p>You are just like them,</p>
<p>in that you are alone,</p>
<p>in a sense,</p>
<p>whether you think so,</p>
<p>or not.</p>
<p>You just might not,</p>
<p>want to call attention to</p>
<p>that.</p>
<p>But isn’t it weird,</p>
<p>that some people</p>
<p>want more and more of that!</p>
<p>They seem to be those,</p>
<p>who really like,</p>
<p>the outdoors.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The point of this is not to say,</p>
<p>you shouldn’t fill your environment</p>
<p>with things and people.</p>
<p>That’s your choice,</p>
<p>and you could make other choices too,</p>
<p>if you wanted.</p>
<p>Just don’t make it seem like,</p>
<p>if others do not choose what you</p>
<p>chose</p>
<p>that their life</p>
<p>is worthless somehow.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Aside: I don’t even agree with my use of worthless</p>
<p>here, but this is fine for now.]</p>

<p>Have you ever thought about the limitations,</p>
<p>around the visibility</p>
<p>of an engagement or wedding ring?</p>
<p>You are attractive.</p>
<p>You are spotted from within your car.</p>
<p>But you are in a committed relationship.</p>
<p>How are you going to make that clear</p>
<p>to that person in the other car?</p>
<p>Are you going to,</p>
<p>stick your hand out of the window,</p>
<p>and point to the ring on your finger?</p>
<p>Or are you,</p>
<p>going to say</p>
<p>“Hey there” back</p>

<p>Or are you going,</p>
<p>to wink,</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>without doing anything,</p>
<p>but continuing,</p>

<p>for your window-shopping</p>

<p>…</p>
<p>An invention idea,</p>
<p>that is incredibly easy,</p>
<p>is simply to have a kind of “wedding ring”</p>
<p>added to one or both of the mirrors.</p>
<p>or someplace else,</p>
<p>it doesn’t really matter,</p>
<p>as long as it is visible,</p>
<p>and nice enough,</p>
<p>to justify the purchase.</p>
<p>It should be luxurious.</p>
<p>Like an actual wedding ring.</p>
<p>“Look I’m taken,</p>
<p>by someone,</p>
<p>who can like,</p>
<p>afford me.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Mirrors on the car,</p>
<p>are like big ears.</p>
<p>I’m thinking of one SUV I had before.</p>
<p>Why not put a big earring on</p>
<p>one or both them.</p>
<p>It’s cool OK?,</p>
<p>and I’m not going to make it,</p>
<p>so it’s a free idea,</p>
<p>for you to work on.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Look at what it would do.</p>
<p>You do realize,</p>
<p>it would actually have an</p>
<p>impact.</p>
<p>Much more of an impact,</p>
<p>than any other thing,</p>
<p>stuck to your car right now.</p>

<p>already accepted.</p>
<p>ad infinitum.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Ad infinitum,</p>
<p>what I said below is supported.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Think about it,</p>
<p>if you were already completely honest</p>
<p>with yourself</p>
<p>about <em>everything</em></p>
<p>wouldn’t you</p>
<p>already be immune</p>
<p>to hearing truths</p>
<p>that you’ve</p>
<p>already heard—</p>
<p>to the point</p>
<p>that you’ve been</p>
<p>desensitized?</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>I know it is hard</p>
<p>to hear certain messages</p>
<p>from certain people,</p>
<p>but even that</p>
<p>is practiced</p>
<p>with complete self-honesty,</p>
<p>if you assume,</p>
<p>different faces and voices.</p>
<p>Because if you are</p>
<p>sensitive to an audience’s perspective,</p>
<p>it is because</p>
<p>you’ve created a fictional account</p>
<p>for them,</p>
<p>such that you are shocked,</p>
<p>when they do not go by that account.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Give yourself a true account of yourself</p>
<p>AND</p>
<p>give everyone else,</p>
<p>that same account.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>I’m still working on the issue,</p>
<p>that many seem</p>
<p>to get their facts wrong.</p>
<p>I cannot anticipate</p>
<p>everything anyone might</p>
<p>say about me,</p>
<p>that is a lie.</p>
<p>Although I do not often lie to myself,</p>
<p>and try to think through all the variations</p>
<p>of lies I might encounter,</p>
<p>I am still taken aback by what I hear,</p>
<p>because I cannot anticipate everything,</p>
<p>other people might say.</p>
<p>However,</p>
<p>I’m becoming immune to this</p>
<p>variation too,</p>
<p>since the messages</p>
<p>tend to carry,</p>
<p>the same unnecessary</p>
<p>emotions and attitudes.</p>
<p>But still,</p>
<p>I have not encountered,</p>
<p>the super weirdo,</p>
<p>psychopathic,</p>
<p>sociopathic,</p>

<p>if you should be aware,</p>
<p>or not.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>There is only so much,</p>
<p>one can prepare oneself for.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Back to the main topic.</p>
<p>It should be clear,</p>
<p>that there is nothing extreme,</p>
<p>in being honest.</p>
<p>Honesty creates resilience.</p>
<p>Your brutal honesty,</p>

<p>Mostly immune.</p>
<p>to “brutal” truths.</p>
<p>They are not brutal.</p>
<p>Well,</p>
<p>the brutality is relative.</p>
<p>This means,</p>
<p>you see it as brutal,</p>

<p>That’s what relative</p>

<h2 id="saw-it-coming."><a name="saw-it-coming">Saw it coming.</a></h2>
<p>Ever see a fighter,</p>
<p>supposedly “cheap shot” an opponent,</p>
<p>and wonder to yourself,</p>
<p>“Did he know to hit first,</p>
<p>because of that look,</p>
<p>on the other person’s face,</p>
<p>and slight motion</p>
<p>in their frame?”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“I saw it coming,</p>
<p>and I chose to win from the start.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Why do I bring this up?</p>
<p>In real life,</p>
<p>people play the appearances game.</p>
<p>They do everything they can,</p>
<p>to injure others,</p>
<p>and either you are required to do the same,</p>
<p>or you can take,</p>
<p>an alternative,</p>
<p>more open and powerful approach.</p>
<p>This puts you at risk,</p>
<p>however,</p>
<p>even though you might be using</p>
<p>less force than your opponent.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>So we think,</p>
<p>the first to strike,</p>
<p>is the one who loses,</p>
<p>because we perceive the</p>
<p>force to be excessive.</p>
<p>Even though it was,</p>
<p>minimal,</p>
<p>by comparison,</p>
<p>to the accumulation,</p>
<p>of small slights,</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Or,</p>
<p>as in the case of the fighter above,</p>
<p>the action was to</p>
<p>prevent the very same from happening,</p>
<p>to himself.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>I will continue to stick to my position,</p>
<p>of letting small things go,</p>
<p>not such that they are forgiven,</p>
<p>but such that they will pile up,</p>
<p>in the pile over there,</p>
<p>mostly out of mind,</p>
<p>but on record,</p>
<p>if the type of person,</p>
<p>deserves such a record.</p>
<p>Then I will hit hard,</p>
<p>and will have no concerns,</p>
<p>whatsoever about it.</p>
<p>Because whatever it is they are doing,</p>
<p>is not something I would do to them.</p>
<p>Although that type of person,</p>
<p>keeps false records too.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“The meek, passive-aggressive person, shall inherit the earth.”</p>
<p>and that earth</p>
<p>would not be worth living in.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Do you know a person,</p>
<p>who cannot get through a single conversation,</p>
<p>without stabbing you somehow?</p>

Whole World is Stuck Here.</a></h2>
<p>There are few exceptions.</p>
<p>You’re not one of them most likely.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p><a
href="christopher-matthew-cavanaugh-thoughtstream.html#most-are-stuck-here">See
the post below</a>.</p>
<p>Don’t be confused.</p>
<p>I mean to say that probably,</p>
<p>you are stuck here.</p>
<p>I do have hopes</p>
<p>for you.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>In religion,</p>
<p>there is the idea,</p>
<p>that the world is wrong,</p>
<p>and that the cult</p>
<p>you are guilted to pay for</p>
<p>and belong to</p>
<p>is right.</p>
<p>The self-designated</p>
<p>“<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remnant_(Bible)">remnant</a>”</p>
<p>is an example of this.</p>
<p>“I just joined a small church,</p>
<p>and now I’m</p>
<p>a survivor.”</p>
<p>Nevermind that “remnants”</p>
<p>disagree with each other,</p>
<p>and have the easiest admission</p>
<p>process possible.</p>
<p>It is easier to become</p>
<p>a chosen person,</p>
<p>than it is to enter</p>
<p>a private Highschool.</p>
<p>You just show up,</p>
<p>and self-designate.</p>
<p>Then,</p>
<p>you pretend your “knowledge”</p>
<p>is secret,</p>
<p>and privately act as though,</p>
<p>everyone is an enemy.</p>
<p>Publicly,</p>
<p>you claim,</p>
<p>that everyone shares the same religion as you.</p>
<p>This is the gimmick,</p>
<p>of the religious cult.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>If they took it seriously,</p>
<p>they would openly declare,</p>
<p>that they are the few,</p>
<p>while everyone else is the many.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>That only a few,</p>
<p>really know quite a lot,</p>
<p>is certainly true,</p>
<p>with respect to knowledge,</p>
<p>however.</p>
<p>So when I state that the world,</p>
<p>is stuck in obvious falsities,</p>
<p>I am saying you probably are too.</p>
<p>These are facts.</p>
<p>This is why we value education.</p>
<p>All of humanity,</p>
<p>for thousands of years,</p>
<p>until recently,</p>
<p>did not have information.</p>
<p>And so the elite of today,</p>
<p>in knowledge,</p>
<p>are the elite for all of history too.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>I will say it to anyone I meet,</p>
<p>when I have nothing to go by,</p>
<p>as far as what they might know.</p>
<p>But I will acknowledge,</p>
<p>that they might be very</p>
<p>honest and knowledgable too,</p>
<p>and that I simply don’t have enough</p>
<p>information yet.</p>
<p>But I will not claim to be in the remnant,</p>
<p>and then act as though,</p>
<p>the remnant doesn’t exist,</p>
<p>in the open,</p>
<p>or first that nobody but my</p>
<p><em>clique</em></p>
<p>…</p>
<p><em>clique</em></p>
<p>is in it,</p>
<p>and later,</p>
<p>that the clique,</p>
<p>includes everyone.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Do you not know what a team is?”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Let us consider that obvious falsities,</p>
<p>do exist.</p>
<p>They do,</p>
<p><em>right</em>?</p>
<p>Who is the keeper,</p>
<p>of obvious falsities?</p>
<p>They get shared,</p>
<p>communicated,</p>
<p>and preserved,</p>
<p>by the bulk of humanity?</p>
<p>I can tell you though,</p>
<p>I do not believe in any</p>
<p>ghosties…</p>
<p>yet,</p>
<p>people do.</p>
<p>How are these ghosties preserved?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Aside: “ghosties” is my placeholder for everything that is obviously
foolish]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is undeniable,</p>
<p>that people are,</p>
<p>preserving,</p>
<p>and communicating,</p>
<p>and believing,</p>
<p>obvious falsities,</p>
<p>else they would have been lost</p>
<p>to history.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>You read about it,</p>
<p>in amusement.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>So yes,</p>
<p>most of the world,</p>
<p>is stuck in that position.</p>
<p>They have some truths,</p>
<p>that is clear,</p>
<p>else they could not,</p>
<p>sew clothing together.</p>
<p>But they also,</p>
<p>are the carriers of the infection,</p>
<p>that is easily cured.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Oh,</p>
<p>and I forgot to mention,</p>
<p>that institutions,</p>
<p>and organizations,</p>
<p>are the keepers of the obvious falsities.</p>
<p>Propaganda is a technique they use.</p>
<p>Bullying and manipulation too.</p>
<p>It would be very difficult,</p>
<p>for individuals,</p>
<p>to preserve ghosties across nations,</p>
<p>if not for organized</p>
<p>misinformation.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Public education,</p>
<p>strives to not be this.</p>
<p>While public education,</p>
<p>is day care</p>
<p>in disguise,</p>
<p>it does have one of the most</p>
<p>valuable missions,</p>
<p>that has ever existed.</p>
<p>Of teaching what is true,</p>
<p>and only what is true.</p>
<p>This is why,</p>
<p>they have rightfully censored,</p>
<p>religion.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>You are more likely to get falsepathed,</p>
<p>at home,</p>
<p>or outside of school.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Remedial education,</p>
<p>for institutions?</p>
<p>“Institution of Ghosties,</p>
<p>hear about,</p>
<p>how there aren’t any.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Another alternative,</p>
<p>already taken:</p>
<p>Shelter them,</p>
<p>from taxes?</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>My religion is philosophy.</p>
<p>I’m excited to build my</p>
<p>new tax shelter.</p>
<p>I will not guilt anyone</p>
<p>into donating.</p>
<p>I am already,</p>
<p>living mostly</p>
<p>tax-free.</p>
<p>But hey,</p>
<p>cash me.</p>

Dynamics.</a></h2>
<p>“When X happens, I do Y.”</p>
<p>That isn’t very effective actually.</p>
<p>Because you are implying,</p>
<p>you do the same thing Y,</p>
<p>under any circumstance X,</p>
<p>but X is too variable,</p>
<p>to call for Y,</p>
<p>every time.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>In other words,</p>
<p>X and Y are not variables,</p>
<p>but are placeholders,</p>
<p>according to the ordinary understanding.</p>
<p>But to work they need to be variables.</p>
<p>Otherwise Y does not apply to X, which will change.</p>
<p>or X does not call for</p>
<ol start="25" type="A">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>What does X call for?</p>
<p>Is a</p>
<p><em>super interesting question</em>.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Situations don’t call for anything it seems.</p>
<p>We just create</p>
<p>advice.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>This variability,</p>
<p>that calls for</p>
<p><em>variables</em></p>
<p>leads to our common feeling,</p>
<p>that advice is amiss.</p>
<p>You,</p>
<p>the person who knows the situation,</p>
<p>has to select from the advice</p>
<p>in the heap.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>You alone can decide what applies.</p>
<p>There’s often no time or capability to explain X,</p>
<p>to tradition.</p>
<p>Tradition won’t respond.</p>
<p>But a thinking person,</p>
<p>might unthinkingly respond,</p>
<p>with something canned</p>
<p>in tradition.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Traditional morality,</p>
<p>has not accounted for this.</p>
<p>This is why morality,</p>
<p>is a heap.</p>
<p>And not an organized</p>
<p><em>method</em></p>
<p>for applying answers,</p>
<p>to real situations.</p>
<p>It’s a matching game</p>
<p>of sorts,</p>
<p>with few rules,</p>
<p>and no way to know,</p>
<p>when it is being done correctly.</p>
<p>We just look at our outcomes,</p>
<p>and think,</p>
<p>it turned out OK</p>
<p>this time.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>There are too many situations.</p>
<p>To simplify,</p>
<p>people pretended,</p>
<p>variation did not exist,</p>
<p>or did not matter,</p>
<p>or was not enough variation,</p>
<p>to justify,</p>
<p>sufficient variation of response.</p>
<p>“My advice is universal”.</p>
<p>Even the best of the philosophers,</p>
<p>fell into this kind of trap.</p>
<p>“I found the supreme principle of morality…”</p>
<p>This guy,</p>
<p>couldn’t figure out,</p>
<p>how to apply the principle</p>
<p>he made up.</p>
<p>He did seem to be,</p>
<p>very honest however.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>When things don’t go well</p>
<p>and people are not helpful</p>
<p>and tradition harms</p>
<p>instead of helping</p>
<p>people tend to think:</p>
<p>“Don’t judge me unless you’ve walked in my shoes.”</p>
<p>“Don’t cast the first stone.”</p>
<p>And variants,</p>
<p>that all mean,</p>
<p>it is hard to understand all the situations,</p>
<p>that can occur.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Tradition,</p>
<p>has not taken any “Hippocratic Oath.”</p>
<p>It’s just a dead and lifeless,</p>
<p>information pile.</p>
<p>The life</p>
<p>of tradition</p>
<p>is in people,</p>
<p>who cough up advice,</p>
<p>committing the mistake of the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_heuristic">availability
heuristic</a>.</p>
<p>We think the first thing that comes to mind,</p>
<p>is the answer.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Listen to advice from your parents.</p>
<p>They are the keepers of tradition,</p>
<p>and they are available,</p>
<p>so they are the easiest to test</p>
<p>this truth on.</p>
<p>When they judge,</p>
<p>and provide advice,</p>
<p>how frequently is it</p>
<p>the very first thing</p>
<p>they think of</p>
<p>when they react</p>
<p>is the advice they give you.</p>
<p>They trust their reactions.</p>
<p>But reactions are variable.</p>
<p>So who’s reaction do you trust?</p>
<p>Your parents or someone else’s?</p>
<p>You are better to trust,</p>
<p>those who take multiple reactions into consideration,</p>
<p>and think things through carefully,</p>
<p>or those,</p>
<p>who have trustworthy intuitions.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>If you look at how advice is given,</p>
<p>one piece of advice is expected to apply,</p>
<p>to situations that are not analogous,</p>
<p>to those that prompted the</p>
<p>creation the advice.</p>
<p>We rarely,</p>
<p>inquire into advice creation events.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>They are gone?</p>
<p>What is the significance?</p>
<p>We cannot find analogies to them!!</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Advice is created,</p>
<p>somehow,</p>
<p>and attains memorability,</p>
<p>and is recorded.</p>
<p>This is how disorganized heaps are created.</p>
<p>Where were the morality architects?</p>
<p>It’s a cluster,</p>
<p>from all sorts of individuals,</p>
<p>in the culture.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>A toolkit is not provided,</p>
<p>that would satisfy variable conditions.</p>
<p>Usually it’s some canned phrase,</p>
<p>taken directly from tradition,</p>
<p>as a mostly thoughtless reaction.</p>
<p>If only we could measure the thoughts,</p>
<p>in the reactions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Aside: For now we ignore that there is nearly always an opposing
piece of advice from tradition]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Did you weigh the options,</p>
<p>or know the options,</p>
<p>in your reaction?</p>
<p>Intuited,</p>
<p>to the regular?</p>
<p>Or intuited,</p>
<p>through the problem,</p>
<p>to the solution?</p>
<p>Can you see the difference?</p>
<p>Some will intuit to the anger.</p>
<p><em>Straight to the anger.</em></p>
<p>…</p>
<p>But if you take X and Y to be variables truly,</p>
<p>where X is a situational input,</p>
<p>and Y is a tool,</p>
<p>within a set of tools,</p>
<p>what you find,</p>
<p>is that you do not really do some static Y,</p>
<p>when some X occurs,</p>
<p>but you use different tools,</p>
<p>alternately,</p>
<p>alternatively,</p>
<p>or in combination,</p>
<p>over time.</p>
<p>This means that,</p>
<p>if you encounter similar situations,</p>
<p>minor differences,</p>
<p>will still call for,</p>
<p>different reactions.</p>
<p>We have trouble,</p>
<p>speaking in terms of,</p>
<p>dynamic time-related combinations and alternations.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>This is truly another problem.</p>
<p>If you accept that X is a variable,</p>
<p>again,</p>
<p>that your situation changes,</p>
<p>then your tool is supposed to vary,</p>
<p>over time.</p>
<p>This is clear,</p>
<p>in athletics,</p>
<p>where improvement,</p>
<p>demands changes in activities.</p>
<p>The situation does not remain the same,</p>
<p>but differs only slightly,</p>
<p>but <em>significantly</em>,</p>
<p>and so the advice,</p>
<p>about what to do,</p>
<p>changes.</p>
<p>Notice that tradition,</p>
<p>does not have this</p>
<p>understanding of dynamics</p>
<p>in situations and solutions.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Let’s take it further.</p>
<p>I was talking about how <em>advice givers</em></p>
<p>change too.</p>
<p>Different people are different inputs into this.</p>
<p>Also,</p>
<p>the advice I would give 5 years ago,</p>
<p>would not be the same</p>
<p>as the advice I would give today.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>It’s really is largely a pile of advice.</p>
<p>The advice givers,</p>
<p>are snatching from the same pile.</p>
<p>And they don’t</p>
<p><em>snatch</em></p>
<p>the same way,</p>
<p>as each other.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Variability in the access of “morality”</p>
<p>exists too.</p>
<p>I mentioned this,</p>
<p>with the availability heuristic.</p>
<p>That is instant memory access,</p>
<p>of moral understanding,</p>
<p>that had no method,</p>
<p>other than first recall.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Advice givers are</p>
<p>a variable.</p>
<p>The advice giver heap.</p>
<p>How do you choose from this heap?</p>
<p>First adult you see in front of you?</p>
<p>The most proximal?</p>
<p>I never met a child,</p>
<p>who sought advice,</p>
<p>by specialization.</p>
<p>Parent know-it-all</p>
<p>generalists.</p>
<p>With no knowledge.</p>
<p>Or training,</p>
<p>or certification.</p>
<p>“How did you become a parent?”</p>
<p>“Well first,</p>
<p>we copulated like animals…”</p>
<p>Parents,</p>
<p>don’t seek advice,</p>
<p>often,</p>
<p>from specialists,</p>
<p>to fill their gaps.</p>
<p>They fill their gaps,</p>
<p>with another</p>
<p>less than justifiable</p>
<p>methodology.</p>

<p>Some advise,</p>
<p>that when you need to “vent”,</p>
<p>to avoid hurting other people,</p>
<p>or yourself,</p>
<p>you should</p>
<p>take it out on a punching bag,</p>

<p>you can try thinking honestly to yourself</p>

<p>You can try to think things through,</p>

<p>The hoarder knows this tension well.</p>
<p>Civilization is a hoarder.</p>
<p>We want to archive.</p>
<p>But we have never been successful at creating any real
permanence.</p>
<p>Change destroys relevance.</p>
<p>History becomes disinteresting.</p>
<p>From the personal level,</p>
<p>to the everything level.</p>
<p>I am thinking about how to record something permanently
meaningful.</p>
<p>I am not fond of pyramids,</p>
<p>because they seem foolish for the effort.</p>
<p>But I keep thinking,</p>
<p>messages have to be inscribed in permanent physical things,</p>
<p>that withstand weathering.</p>

<p>Great plains.</p>

<p>Math would undermine</p>
<p>these plans,</p>

<p>You mean,</p>

<p>That’s what this means.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>What difference does it make which you think</p>
<p>and use?</p>
<p>Well,</p>
<p>“blessings” and “curses”</p>
<p>are prohibited,</p>
<p>or are flagged,</p>
<p>by our <a href="lists.html">list</a>.</p>
<p>The first one makes you think:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>That you are important.</li>
<li>That you are actually “blessed” in a supernatural way. It’s fine to
think you have advantages to be grateful for. But it is another thing to
think, you have received supernatural preference.</li>
<li>That you are cursed. This doesn’t really help at all.</li>
</ol>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Pros and cons” works for many things,</p>
<p>over and above</p>
<p>“blessings and curses”.</p>
<p>It is just a better tool.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>But let me fill you in on something.</p>
<p>Analysing using pluses and minuses</p>
<p>is also a <em>basic</em> way of looking at it.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>You can tell this is true,</p>
<p>while you are doing it.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>So,</p>
<p>if you think in terms of</p>
<p>blessing and a curses,</p>
<p>you are either,</p>
<p>falling into a cultural trap</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Aside: I fell into it this morning.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>or you are possibly superstitious</p>
<p>and maybe unaware of more</p>
<p>sophisticated ways of thinking,</p>
<p>that bring you closer to truth.</p>
<p>pros and cons,</p>
<p>is one more sophisticated way of looking at it,</p>
<p>that is hardly sophisticated.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Later we’ll get to a higher level,</p>
<p>but for now,</p>
<p>let’s leave the lowest level.</p>

Ideas for People Who Can Make Movies, One.</a></h2>
<p>When is a robot with AI truly human-like?</p>
<p>When is it “alive”, in the sense that humans are alive?</p>
<p>This is not a new question. It has been covered in science
fiction,</p>
<p>probably innumerable times.</p>
<p><em>Star Trek</em>.</p>
<p>Kubrick’s <em>2001 Space Odyssey</em>.</p>
<p>And others.</p>
<p>Let’s take this idea one step further.</p>
<p>Humans created useful human-like robots.</p>
<p>They are improved and refined, until the life of the robots,</p>
<p>seems more desirable,</p>
<p>than human life itself.</p>
<p>The means of copying human brains,</p>
<p>into digital brains is completed.</p>
<p>Suddenly there are thousands of robots,</p>
<p>supposedly having human minds.</p>
<p>They behave and act exactly like humans.</p>
<p>They seem more advanced, more secure,</p>
<p>and more immortal than humans.</p>
<p>But nobody is quite sure,</p>
<p>if they are actually alive,</p>
<p>or if they are merely simulating human lives,</p>
<p>in incredibly complex ways.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Time progresses,</p>
<p>the new form of life seems so much more desirable,</p>
<p>than human life,</p>
<p>that most have made the switch.</p>
<p>only a small number of humans exist.</p>
<p>They have to make the decision,</p>
<p>to end humanity,</p>
<p>at the risk,</p>
<p>that the new life form,</p>
<p>isn’t life at all.</p>
<p>Perhaps guaranteeing,</p>
<p>that there will never be any other form of life,</p>
<p>ever again in the universe.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Or else,</p>
<p>the decision is made,</p>
<p>because humans,</p>
<p>were automata,</p>
<p>with no more significance than the robots,</p>
<p>all along.</p>
<p>It’s just life,</p>
<p>renewed.</p>
<p>Nature,</p>
<p>taking its next step,</p>
<p>through us.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Add some drama and all that,</p>
<p>and I think this is a good movie plot.</p>

<p>will be able to sort out truths?</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Why not make it easier,</p>
<p>and help them</p>
<p>instantly cancel out</p>
<p>obviously false things.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Then we can rely on them</p>
<p>and aid them</p>
<p>in the hard work finding</p>
<p>the trickier falsities that exist,</p>
<p>that would take a while to find,</p>
<p>and not require them,</p>
<p>to find <em>all of the falsities</em>,</p>
<p>including those that are the very easiest to detect,</p>
<p>but are pervasive and numerous,</p>
<p>and are encountered,</p>
<p>nearly randomly,</p>
<p>over many years,</p>
<p>and not all at once.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>If I taught logic,</p>
<p>I would from the start,</p>
<p>point out the set of all words,</p>
<p>that we can trust,</p>
<p>will falsify sentences,</p>
<p>and then will introduce,</p>
<p>the more difficult concepts,</p>
<p>that are taught in logic,</p>
<p>as logic.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="lists.html">Aside: I returned to actually start this
here</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>…</p>
<p>I’m not sure logicians,</p>
<p>understand what it is they are really</p>
<p>trying to teach,</p>
<p>or do?</p>
<p>Otherwise,</p>
<p>we would not have so many</p>
<p>Introductory logic texts,</p>
<p>that vary mostly in syntactical preferences,</p>
<p>than in anything useful.</p>
<p>I feel they are</p>
<p>trying to show,</p>
<p>they understand logic,</p>
<p>but not what it’s</p>
<p>for.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>I suggest that courses in logic,</p>
<p>should become standard in elementary school,</p>
<p>because first of all,</p>
<p>it is easy,</p>
<p>and second of all,</p>
<p>children should be able to start sorting out,</p>
<p>truth from falsity,</p>
<p>while they are young,</p>
<p>and not only when they are old.</p>
<p>How sad is it</p>
<p>that people have to sort it all out</p>
<p>on their own.</p>
<p>And this way,</p>
<p>kids can identify,</p>
<p>if their parents are at all logical,</p>
<p>and determine,</p>
<p>if they are to be trusted.</p>
<p>It is weird to me,</p>
<p>that parents don’t realize,</p>
<p>that other parents,</p>
<p>are harmful to their own children.</p>
<p>This is a primary issue with society.</p>
<p>Parents.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>If I were orphaned,</p>
<p>I’d want parents.</p>
<p><em>But not just any parents!!!</em></p>
<p>Some homes,</p>
<p>are dungeons.</p>
<p>Are you not aware,</p>
<p>of cults</p>
<p>and psychopaths?</p>
<p>Choose a mental disorder,</p>
<p>and someone’s parents</p>
<p>has that.</p>
<p><em>Get it?</em></p>
<p>…</p>
<p>A core problem in life is</p>
<p>“Who can I trust?”</p>
<p>Some learn while very young,</p>
<p>they could not trust,</p>
<p>those they were told they should rely on.</p>
<p>So why not teach them,</p>
<p>from the very first,</p>
<p>to trust themselves,</p>
<p>as long as they can,</p>
<p><em>trust in logic</em>,</p>
<p>and clear thinking.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>This is much better than,</p>
<p>“You might have nothing at all</p>
<p>to trust.”</p>
<p>The very best,</p>
<p>of what can trusted,</p>
<p>can be made available,</p>
<p>to anyone and everyone.</p>
<p>It is logic,</p>
<p>and clear thinking.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>I need to say more about this topic</p>
<p>later.</p>

<p>…</p>
<p>Let’s talk about 13.</p>
<p>There are still buildings today,</p>
<p>that have no 13<sup>th</sup> floor.</p>
<p>This was only because of superstition.</p>
<p>People wouldn’t buy property on the 13<sup>th</sup> floor.</p>
<p>So they would simply go from the 12<sup>th</sup>,</p>
<p>to the 14<sup>th</sup> floor.</p>
<p>So people would buy property on the 14<sup>th</sup> floor
instead.</p>
<p>But that was just the 13<sup>th</sup> floor renamed.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Think about how common,</p>
<p>this superstition had to have been,</p>
<p>to have built buildings,</p>
<p>without 13<sup>th</sup> floors?</p>
<p>Elevators had to have 12<sup>th</sup> and 14<sup>th</sup> floor
buttons.</p>
<p>Mailboxes had to skip numbers with 13.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Superstition is embarrassing.</p>
<p>It’s costly.</p>
<p>See the list below.</p>
<p>Not only have we been unable to create logic classes,</p>
<p>that were logical enough,</p>
<p>to teach what in our culture is really false,</p>
<p>but we tolerate,</p>
<p>in public education,</p>
<p>the continuation of these ridiculous ideas.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Part of my religion,</p>
<p>which is philosophy,</p>
<p>is anti-superstition.</p>

id="challenge-iii.-find-words-that-dont-appear-in-true-statements."><a name="challenge-three-find-words-that-dont-appear-in-true-sentences">Challenge
III. Find words that don’t appear in true statements.</a></h2>
<p>These are mostly useless, superstitious words.</p>
<p>Well, they are useful in a literary sense.</p>
<p>We can make interesting films and novels using them.</p>
<p>But usually we fail to make sense at all,</p>
<p>when we use them,</p>
<p>in real life.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The word “conjure” came to mind today.</p>
<p>It’s funny. I was having a good time with it.</p>
<p>On reflection, I don’t think it has ever been used in a true
sentence.</p>
<p>This might be hyperbole,</p>
<p>but it is close to the truth nevertheless.</p>
<p>Unless you say something like:</p>
<p>“They thought they could conjure dead relatives, but it turns out,
there is no way to conjure anything.”</p>
<p>But this is true,</p>
<p>because,</p>
<p>it is basically making the point I’m making,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>For challenge three,</p>
<p>I suggest we find words</p>
<p>that never appear in true statements,</p>
<p>unless the sentence is like the one above,</p>
<p>negating its reality in some way.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Example.</p>
<p>“Resurrection.”</p>
<p>This is something that just never happens.</p>
<p>It never happened either.</p>
<p>You can have more faith in me stating this,</p>
<p>than in whatever else,</p>
<p>anyone might tell you about it.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>If I insist that Benjamin Franklin needs to be resurrected,</p>
<p>to get his opinion on gun control,</p>
<p>I’m not being serious.</p>
<p>I’m joking about how resurrection is as impossible,</p>
<p>as getting Benjamin Franklin’s opinion on the topic.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>More examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Demon</li>
<li>Devil</li>
<li>Ghost</li>
<li>Spirit</li>
<li>Benjamin Franklin (if used for something present).</li>
<li>Equality (of complex things taken in total).</li>
</ul>
<p>None of these things refer to anything,</p>
<p>so we can expect,</p>
<p>that these terms are more useful in a literary sense,</p>
<p>for our amusement,</p>
<p>for persuasion and marketing,</p>
<p>and so forth,</p>
<p>than for conveying truths.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>If someone claims you are a devil for example,</p>
<p>they aren’t making a true statement.</p>
<p>You shouldn’t be offended.</p>
<p>You should laugh.</p>
<p>“X is a Devil” is always false.</p>
<p>“X has been resurrected” is always false.</p>
<p>“X was conjured by Beelzebub” is always false.</p>
<p>“I was visited by a Ghost at night” is always false.</p>
<p>“The spirit of Great Grandma is watching me” is always false.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Aside: You don’t believe that anyways in practice, otherwise Tinder
would not be something you would have a login for.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Benjamin Franklin thinks X” (where X is a topic of current events),
is always false.</p>
<p>“Bill and Jane are Equal” (Where both are complex objects taken in
total) is always false.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>At this point you should see how this can be made useful.</p>
<p>You can completely ignore what anyone says about anything and
everything,</p>
<p>taking these things seriously.</p>
<p>Take a look at my notes on <a
href="imagination-and-filtration-dark-green-notebook.html">imagination
and filtration</a>.</p>
<p>On Attention.</p>
<p>Our attention is very valuable.</p>
<p>We want to use our minds for true things,</p>
<p>or fun and amusing things,</p>
<p>and not superstitious things.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>To an extent we can use a list such as this,</p>
<p>as a guide,</p>
<p>to determine just how much we should interact with someone else.</p>
<p>“This person believes in 600 things on the list of 2000
ridiculous</p>
<p>sentence-falsifying terms?”</p>
<p>That’s a scary person.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Is that your parent?</p>
<p>If that’s your parent,</p>
<p>remember you are free to believe whatever you find true,</p>
<p>and deny whatever you think is false.</p>
<p>Your mind is free.</p>
<p>You don’t belong to your parents.</p>
<p>Your country is unable to ensure that you are educated</p>
<p>by parents</p>
<p>who</p>
<p>believe true things.</p>
<p>But since we insist</p>
<p>that parents do guide correctly,</p>
<p>you can think of them as being interchangeable.</p>
<p>You can substitute the teachings,</p>
<p>of your friend’s parents,</p>
<p>for your own.</p>
<p>If you prefer.</p>
<p>It is not fair that they had parents</p>
<p>who knew things,</p>
<p>when your parents didn’t.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Ask your logic teacher,</p>
<p>to provide you the more complete list,</p>
<p>and learn,</p>
<p>they don’t have one.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>I’ll add a list here.</p>
<p>Let’s make a list together.</p>

<h2
id="risks-of-not-knowing-your-rights-and-not-really-having-rights."><a name="risks-of-not-knowing-your-rights">Risks
of not knowing your rights, and not really having rights.</a></h2>
<p>I’ve said before that I don’t really believe in rights,</p>
<p>but in something more valuable than rights.</p>
<p>I’m more concerned that,</p>
<p>whatever it is that is desired is actually secured.</p>
<p>That you actually have what is supposedly established,</p>
<p>through such a right.</p>
<p><em>through such a right</em></p>
<p>But rights don’t work hard for you.</p>
<p>In fact they do nothing but exist in writing,</p>
<p>until someone takes action regarding them.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>One example I’ve given before involves providing access to water.</p>
<p>Suppose there is a right to water.</p>
<p>In Flint Michigan, it would be unclear what that right actually
means.</p>
<p>Water has to be provided by technology and work.</p>
<p>So I would prefer a system that provides water access,</p>
<p>to any right to access.</p>
<p>Because on the one hand, the work was actually done,</p>
<p>on the other hand,</p>
<p>nothing might ever get done.</p>
<p>There is a big difference between having an infrastructure for
something,</p>
<p>and having nothing,</p>
<p>but words indicating,</p>
<p>that something should be provided,</p>
<p>given enough money and resources,</p>
<p>to mobilize people to actually</p>
<p>start to create that same technology?</p>
<p>By basic human processes,</p>
<p>involving the legal system,</p>
<p>and lawyers and so forth?</p>
<p>If there was already a system to deliver water,</p>
<p>there is no need for any right to water,</p>
<p>except maybe</p>
<p>as a <em>last resort.</em></p>
<p>“Rights as a last resort”</p>
<p>is not how people usually think about it,</p>
<p>but it is much closer to the truth.</p>
<p>And many do not ever get what they supposedly,</p>
<p>have rights to.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>If you don’t think that this is the case,</p>
<p>consider the legal system,</p>
<p>where you are told, that you will be taken advantage of,</p>
<p>if you don’t know what your rights are.</p>
<p>This means,</p>
<p>not only that your rights are not secured for you,</p>
<p>that you can only secure your rights yourself.</p>
<p>Furthermore,</p>
<p>you are at a disadvantage,</p>
<p>if you cannot afford legal counsel.</p>
<p>Through this we can see that,</p>
<p>if you are poor,</p>
<p>are unintelligent,</p>
<p>have any disadvantages whatsoever relating to</p>
<p>not understanding the law,</p>
<p>or the legal process,</p>
<p>or having funds to obtain counsel,</p>
<p>you are at risk,</p>
<p>of not having your rights secured for you.</p>
<p>So this is why I am correct,</p>
<p>when I say that rights,</p>
<p>do not actually obtain anything for you.</p>
<p>It is much better to have something,</p>
<p>than to have rights.</p>

<h2 id="legacy-in-the-eternity"><a name="legacy-in-the-eternity">Legacy
in the eternity?</a></h2>
<p>Eternity is a long time.</p>
<p>We know this, but</p>
<p>we don’t know it in practice,</p>
<p>or in planning.</p>
<p>How long is a legacy supposed to last?</p>
<p>A legacy of a few years does not</p>
<p>seem to be something of great value.</p>
<p>This is why I do not concern myself with having a legacy.</p>
<p>By this I do not mean to say</p>
<p>that I don’t think my work</p>
<p>is of importance.</p>
<p>Instead,</p>
<p>I mean to point out,</p>
<p>that no deceased human is known after 200 years,</p>
<p>except in name.</p>
<p>Pythagoras.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>A rare few will read and</p>
<p>understand the mind,</p>
<p>of an eminent person,</p>
<p>through their writing.</p>
<p>But that is only if they wrote something.</p>
<p>People who I know,</p>
<p>who are concerned with legacies,</p>
<p>do not write,</p>
<p>and seem more concerned,</p>
<p>with some sort of</p>
<p>sexual conquest.</p>
<p>Which is why</p>
<p>Personally,</p>
<p>I prefer to write,</p>
<p>and if I want anyone at all to have any understanding</p>
<p>of my mind,</p>
<p>I need to first of all,</p>
<p>write it down.</p>
<p>There’s much to be said.</p>
<p>This is why I think</p>
<p>“getting it out into the world unedited”</p>
<p>is so important.</p>
<p>To me that is vastly superior,</p>
<p>than having nothing written at all,</p>
<p>only to trust others,</p>
<p>who have no idea what you would write,</p>
<p>to tell a story,</p>
<p>that ends up being theirs and not yours,</p>
<p>no matter who they happen to be,</p>
<p>and how close the relationship.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>In ten thousand years, no one will have time,</p>
<p>or any interest,</p>
<p>in reading anything I write.</p>
<p>No one can tell my story,</p>
<p>but myself,</p>
<p>and the audience dwindles,</p>
<p>as millennia pass by.</p>
<p>Could you ask your great grandchild,</p>
<p>100 generations from now,</p>
<p>in a will,</p>
<p>to read my memoirs?</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>What is the lifespan of a will?</p>
<p>How long,</p>
<p>can we expect</p>
<p>someone to honor a time-capsule?</p>
<p>This is why there are pyramids,</p>
<p>and everyone,</p>
<p>already knows what was inside of those.</p>
<p>Mostly</p>
<p>really ancient</p>
<p>useless</p>
<p>stuff.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Which leaves only one legacy of interest:</p>
<p>How can I make my mark upon the destiny of the world itself?</p>
<p>Everyone does this easily.</p>
<p>This is where the Pharoahs actually had an impact.</p>
<p>Although we know next to nothing about them,</p>
<p>and <em>we</em> chose their legacies for them!</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>But even if we consider changing the world</p>
<p>something of great importance to pursue,</p>
<p>we have the troublesome issue,</p>
<p>that everything appears to be predetermined.</p>
<p>So even what you do,</p>
<p>is what you will do.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>For these reasons I do not concern myself with</p>
<p>having a legacy,</p>
<p>but work anyway.</p>
<p>And this is why,</p>
<p>I have a planned extinction event,</p>
<p>for my lineage,</p>
<p>when I die,</p>
<p>there will be nobody else,</p>
<p>to claim they came from me.</p>
<p>Biologically at least.</p>
<p>If your child,</p>
<p>wants to claim they came from me,</p>
<p>somehow,</p>
<p>that is fine.</p>
<p>But I don’t think,</p>
<p>that will result in an eternal legacy.</p>
<p>My extinction is immanent.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Life is easier,</p>
<p>without the demands of</p>
<p>planning for a legacy.</p>
<p>There are just too many people to pay for,</p>
<p>and too many people</p>
<p>to manipulate.</p>
<p>That’s not “Mattanaw”.</p>
<p>Then there’s the problem</p>
<p>of who they will become,</p>
<p>regardless of my efforts,</p>
<p>to educate them,</p>
<p>according to my visions.</p>
<p>While I would think the right DNA would pass to my offspring,</p>
<p>there is little evidence,</p>
<p>that DNA,</p>
<p>will create the children,</p>
<p>I imagine,</p>
<p>when I’m using my imagination.</p>
<p>They always become,</p>
<p>something utterly different.</p>
<p>Better than expected,</p>
<p>or something different than expected,</p>
<p>but never,</p>
<p><em>what was expected</em>.</p>
<p>Wanting a legacy,</p>
<p>creates high expectations.</p>
<p>All my children have to be recyclers,</p>
<p>if not saints.</p>
<p>Never will there be,</p>
<p>someone,</p>
<p>with a legacy greater</p>
<p>than my own,</p>
<p>or one opposite to my own.</p>
<p>How do you plan to</p>
<p>outdo your parent’s legacies?</p>
<p>Surely,</p>
<p>you are not merely,</p>
<p>ensuring their legacy continues,</p>
<p>without any concern for your own,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>Then this conversation,</p>
<p>would only be about,</p>
<p>our ancestor’s legacies,</p>
<p>and never our own.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Suppose I decided</p>
<p>instead I would have a legacy,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>I had 10 children,</p>
<p>each of whom had 10 children,</p>
<p>whom had 10 children more.</p>
<p>After 3 generations,</p>
<p>they would not know each other,</p>
<p>there would be so many.</p>
<p>And if I had the</p>
<p><em>power</em></p>
<p>to create a legacy,</p>
<p>upon all these families,</p>
<p>my legacy,</p>
<p>would be one they might wish to escape,</p>
<p>or one to overcome,</p>
<p>or emulate,</p>
<p>but not merely maintain.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Aside: Nobody of worth <em>ever</em> simply looks upon the
achievement of their ancestors as something to simply remain
unchanged].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I say this while keeping in mind,</p>
<p>that children and grandchildren,</p>
<p>do love and admire their grandparents,</p>
<p>and remember them</p>
<p>sometimes.</p>
<p>But I do not know who my great-great-great grandparents were,</p>
<p>would probably rarely think of them if I did,</p>
<p>and 10,000 years from now,</p>
<p>maybe everyone on earth,</p>
<p>will be related to my grandparents,</p>
<p>in some way.</p>
<p>Nobody truly looks to the origin of the species,</p>
<p>for inspiration,</p>
<p><a
href="christopher-matthew-cavanaugh-thoughtstream.html#pay-homage-to-animal-grandma">great-grandma
australopithecus</a>.</p>
<p>She has no legacy whatsoever,</p>
<p>and everything depended on her!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Aside: and she does not mind it. The dead are not concerned about
legacies.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>…</p>
<p>Since the desire to leave a legacy,</p>
<p>involves a desire to control,</p>
<p>people who don’t even exist yet,</p>
<p>who will somehow selflessly create the</p>
<p>selfish vision of</p>
<p>some guy at the top,</p>
<p>of a self-created “success pyramid”,</p>
<p>I find it mostly disgusting and</p>
<p>abhorrent.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Aside: Women seem less concerned about legacies and more concerned
about familial well-being. I greatly prefer that perspective].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Never have I heard some guy talk of leaving a legacy,</p>
<p>without feeling some disgust concerning his motives.</p>
<p>At the same time, of course, I understand their desire to create a
family,</p>
<p>which is not the same thing,</p>
<p>as trying to create a legacy.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>I will remember my parents and grandparents fondly,</p>
<p>but they will certainly not have</p>
<p>eternal legacies.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>After this clear and</p>
<p>easy</p>
<p>destruction of</p>
<p>legacy,</p>
<p>in the eternity,</p>
<p>I will turn my attention to</p>
<p>inheritance.</p>
<p>Since the root of so many of our issues with social justice,</p>
<p>involves how and where we start our lives.</p>
<p>I think we need to consider,</p>
<p>what role,</p>
<p>handing down money from parent to child,</p>
<p>really should have,</p>
<p>if we are to claim that there is any</p>
<p>sort of equality that makes sense.</p>
<p>There must be a better strategy,</p>
<p>to ensure a more just distribution,</p>
<p>of life starting-points.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Parents cannot choose their children,</p>
<p>but children cannot choose their parents either.</p>
<p>If parents have no resources,</p>
<p>we cannot pretend,</p>
<p>that disadvantages will be corrected,</p>
<p>by changes with public education and affirmative action.</p>
<p>They have to go home,</p>
<p>to be with their ignorant parents,</p>
<p>and whatever home and neighborhood,</p>
<p>they are unlucky enough,</p>
<p>to find themselves in.</p>
<p>It’s about cash and resources.</p>
<p>People who inherit,</p>
<p>are,</p>
<p>well,</p>
<p>not exactly <em>deserving</em> in any</p>
<p>meaningful way.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Of course,</p>
<p>making everyone start from a position</p>
<p>of health and well being,</p>
<p>and plentiful resources,</p>
<p>will not equalize our DNA,</p>
<p>and it shouldn’t,</p>
<p>because we need strength in diversity.</p>
<p>But what it will do is</p>
<p>make</p>
<p>meritocracy something that’s not just</p>
<p>bullshit!!</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Elimination of</p>
<p>inheritance might not be the answer.</p>
<p>Some diversity might be beneficial here too,</p>
<p>but I would prefer,</p>
<p>no inheritance to inheritance,</p>
<p>given the forced decision,</p>
<p>because the idea of a lasting</p>
<p>legacy is nonsense.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Have you ever questioned</p>
<p>your motive of having a legacy?</p>
<p>Where did you even,</p>
<p>get such an idea,</p>
<p>if you had one?</p>

to get out of caring about waste.</a></h2>
<p>The best way to reduce waste, is to not have children.</p>
<p>I haven’t had any children.</p>
<p>And this means, I do not need to be concerned about waste at all.</p>
<p>I’ve done my part.</p>
<p>Let’s compare by the tonnage.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Aside: I’ve been the person who would cut down dramatically on
waste, and was a re-user, sorter, recycler, hypermiler, bike commuter,
etc… I would carry utensils, a re-usable towel, re-usable bags, and so
on around with me, so I would not use disposable materials in fast food
places, and so I could avoid avoid buying plastic bags at checkout
lines. I lived in a studio apartment for a long time partly for this
reason. If you cut down on waste well, you make yourself an oddball (not
that I’m against being the strange you want to see in the world).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What does this mean?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You are socially expected to do a poor job at it, and have plenty of
children, who are as bad as you are at it, but probably worse. They
don’t really know how to do any of the things you’ve learned to do, and
nobody re-uses diapers…].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This will make the world a better place,</p>
<p>because we will stop doing pointless activities,</p>
<p>pretending that we are making change somehow.</p>
<p>And some pretend,</p>
<p>that this is the good they are doing in the world,</p>
<p>and it’s all that they are doing!</p>

<h2
id="what-medium-does-your-strategy-take"><a name="what-medium-does-your-strategy-take">What
medium does your strategy take?</a></h2>
<p>Perhaps this makes it more clear, what I said before.</p>
<p>I question the extent to which anyone actually has a strategy,</p>
<p>when they say they have one.</p>
<p>“Can you show me your strategy?”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>As kids grow up, they learn ways to handle situations</p>
<p>such that we might say they have strategies,</p>
<p>to avoid having their lies detected,</p>
<p>avoid getting in trouble with elders,</p>
<p>and so on…</p>
<p>We can all recall,</p>
<p>having strategies,</p>
<p>for such things.</p>
<p>And we know they would be able to tell us what their strategies
are,</p>
<p>if they were asked,</p>
<p>in a consequence-free environment.</p>
<p>Most likely.</p>
<p>This information could then be translated into some medium,</p>
<p>such that a tangible strategy comes into existence.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>It’s a little different for adults, who claim to have</p>
<p>bigger,</p>
<p>loftier strategies.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>This isn’t merely about communication.</p>
<p>A strategy that is just in someone’s mind is dubious,</p>
<p>and is more likely to be a cluster of thoughts,</p>
<p>not really a strategy at all,</p>
<p>and certainly probably not strategie<em>s</em>.</p>
<p>When things are complex,</p>
<p>strategies don’t tend to exist.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Personally, I intend to record my strategies,</p>
<p>such that I can say I have them.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Adults seem to not know when they have a strategy,</p>
<p>and when they don’t.</p>
<p>Or at least,</p>
<p>they confuse learned behavioral strategies,</p>
<p>they can no longer communicate,</p>
<p>or identify,</p>
<p>for strategies,</p>
<p>that can be used.</p>
<p>Because if you cannot communicate a strategy,</p>
<p>how do you know,</p>
<p>that you are using one,</p>
<p>when you are supposedly using it?</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>So,</p>
<p>Is it on paper?</p>
<p>Is it in the computer as a process diagram?</p>
<p>Did you write a program for it?</p>
<p>Did you write a narrative about it?</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Or is <em>it</em> just a glob of brain tissue,</p>
<p>somewhere in a head?</p>
<p>I will bet it’s just brain tissue,</p>
<p>scattered without much unity,</p>
<p>somewhere in a head.</p>
<p>In business, sometimes it isn’t even in the head</p>
<p>of the manager,</p>
<p>claiming to have the strategy.</p>

<p>One way to extend your freedom,</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>If you register as an independent,</p>
<p>or as “unaffiliated”,</p>

<p>remember that this does not entail</p>

<p>Instead,</p>
<p>you can be as open minded,</p>
<p>as perhaps you pretend to be.</p>
<p>By actually being independently minded.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>A test of open mindedness,</p>
<p>is how independently minded you happen to be.</p>
<p>[Aside: This does not mean you ought not commit to some of the same
things others commit to. The extent that you should commit to anything
and everything other people commit to is questionable. I.e. commitments
to everything espoused by large institutions, like the church. Where
people are actually, in fact, more independent minded than they are
willing to admit, and perhaps not as independently minded or outspoken

do you handle ambiguity?”</a></h2>
<p>Is a common interview question,</p>
<p>although I never heard it myself in an interview.</p>
<p>It’s used to gauge a person’s comfort working in an environment where
not everything can be</p>
<p>made orderly,</p>
<p>due to excess complexity,</p>
<p>lack of time,</p>
<p>or some other reason.</p>
<p>It’s a question about coping,</p>
<p>and getting through ambiguous circumstances,</p>
<p>and not about really “handling” it.</p>
<p>I find it to be an attempt to rule out problem solvers…</p>
<p>When I encounter ambiguity, I try to fix it…</p>
<p>if that turns out to be possible.</p>
<p>Is this not what one wants from an employee,</p>
<p>to find solutions to business problems,</p>
<p>of all kinds whenever that is possible?</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The reason I think it is an attempt to rule out problem solvers,</p>
<p>is because the people who thrive in ambiguity,</p>
<p>are those who try to take advantage of it,</p>
<p>for sneaky purposes,</p>
<p>and not those who try to correct it,</p>
<p>else there would be less ambiguity,</p>
<p>handed down to the new candidate.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Or I try to see,</p>
<p>using my intuition,</p>
<p>what matters in the cloud of the unimportant,</p>
<p>if truly there is no time,</p>
<p>to fix anything,</p>
<p>and only decisions are necessary.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The oddest thing,</p>
<p>is that people who ask this question,</p>
<p>will expect the candidate,</p>
<p>once hired,</p>
<p>to control future events and circumstances,</p>
<p>to creates success.</p>
<p>And if they fail to do so,</p>
<p>they might be “fired”,</p>
<p>[Aside: their employment contract might end].</p>
<p>but in almost all cases,</p>
<p>even the near-term future of the business,</p>
<p>is ambiguous.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Clever interviewer… how do you handle the ambiguity of</p>
<p>Q2 2020 since it’s currently only Q3 2019?</p>
<p>Or how about Q4 2020?</p>
<p>Do you want to know my</p>
<p>5-year plan for growing your business?”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The stockholders,</p>
<p>are interested in how you handle that ambiguity,</p>
<p>by <strong>NOT</strong> trying to control it.</p>

id="infinite-recursion-continued"><a name="infinite-recursion-continued">Infinite
Recursion Continued…</a></h2>
<p>Historically people have found infinite recursion to be somehow
offensive to reason. But my opinion, is that recursion is useful as far
as it is useful, for describing whatever it happens to describe.</p>
<p>I have no issue thinking that I have some endless number of mothers
in my heritage, but at some point, it fails to be descriptive to say I
had a mother, way back in time.</p>
<p>But we can’t take this to mean that we can arbitrarily choose a date
where our first mother came into existence.</p>
<p>It means that whatever happened to be my first mother, wasn’t very
clearly a mother in the way that we think of our more immediate
parent.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>It could be, that the reason for disliking infinite recursion relates
to an intuition about instrumentality, or to an intuition that no
exemplar has been found, apart from, perhaps, natural processes
themselves (since we cannot identify a beginning or end to
<em>everything</em>).</p>
<p>Instrumentality of the explanation will be questionable wherever
there is no explanation…</p>
<p>And therefore we cannot say that infinite recursion does not
apply,</p>
<p>or that there is, again, some arbitrary starting point that we think
we can identify.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Failure to perceive that an instance of recursion would be
instrumental is not the same as identifying where the recursion should
happen to start or end.</p>
<p>Infinite recursion of everything could be preferable for reasons that
we would understand, if we came to understand the reasons.</p>
<p>Infinite recursion continued…</p>

<p>Infinite recursion is just fine with me. It is a matter of
instrumentality. Freedom depends on it, kindof. Maybe even a heightened,
more useless recursive conception of freedom as well. I enjoy that some
other people enjoy that others disagree with them politically. Maybe
someone can enjoy that I have that enjoyment. Maybe someone else can
enjoy that I enjoy <em>that</em>. Woah, that’s super permissive and
tolerant, and inactively distant. Maybe I can vaguely enjoy their
enjoyment. It goes on and on, and it becomes more useless as it gets
more abstract, but we can make a contest of it. Whoever can make the
least useful abstraction wins in the “I believe in freedom the most”
war.</p>

<h2
id="lose-weight-to-see-your-body."><a name="lose-weight-to-see-your-body">Lose
Weight to See Your Body.</a></h2>
<p>This sounds obvious but it is not as obvious as you might expect. If
you are naturally skinny you might take it completely for granted!</p>
<p>One aspect of weight loss that is easily overlooked, but is very
important, is that a person cannot actually see easily correctable and
important physical asymmetries, imperfections, and errors in form, until
a sufficient amount of body fat is lost.</p>
<p>I lost weight several times. The most I ever lost was 100 pounds,
when I dropped from 270 pounds to about 165.</p>
<p>I’ve gone through the experience of having mostly a dull view of my
musculature and my movements, to having an increasingly clear view as I
dropped pounds.</p>
<p>To give just one example of many: until I’m at about 180 pounds, I
cannot tell if my legs are of equal size.</p>
<p>Only now, after reaching that weight, am I able to see I need
significant work on my left inner quadricep to make it equal to my
right.</p>
<p>I experienced atrophy to this muscle because of arthroscropic knee
surgery, but I forgot about it, or at least I failed to notice it, until
I lost enough weight to actually see the problem.</p>
<p>It’s almost like the experience of shaving, only to reveal that there
was some acne or other imperfections hidden by the hair.</p>
<p>Why is this a problem? A physical therapist would tell you that if
you don’t correct it, it will affect other parts of your body as you
age, making the problem more and more severe.</p>
<p>Perhaps more severe than this asymmetry, is the difference between my
two pectoral muscles, created by an injury to my left tricep when I was
a teenager. Failing to strengthen my left tricep led to excess use of my
left pectoral muscle when doing chest exercises. Now my left pectoral is
much larger than my right, my right tricep is much larger than my left,
and I have considerable difficulty creating the right shoulder positions
when doing a whole variety of exercises working my shoulders, chest, and
my upper back.</p>
<p>This becomes increasingly obvious as weight is lost, but when we are
heavier, it is concealed by extra body fat.</p>
<p>So obesity creates more risks than we would normally think about.
It’s not just about heart health. It’s about being able to even have
visibility about what is going on directly underneath our skin. Being
thinner allows for being able to have a better estimate about what is
going on with musculature, the skeletal system, and anything else that
might be concealed that is easily overlooked.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Similarly, when I was heavier, it was harder to notice improper
form.</p>
<p>If you are thin, like a dancer, any irregularities of movement would
be readily apparent.</p>
<p>Somehow we are better able to notice movements in thin, graceful
appendages and bodies, which makes dancers so attractive to begin with
when they have mastered their artform.</p>
<p>More total movement is apparent when viewing thin dancers than
dancers who are heavy.</p>
<p>I think this is because a line covering a path between one location
and another, creates a long visible distance. There is greater
white-space in the movement from one position to the next, making the
total distance of movement seem longer. When heavier, an arm that is
fatter would cover more area in space, and when it changes position,
there would be less apparent whitespace.</p>
<p>So graceful dancers achieve their beauty of movement by apparently
covering more background as they change positions.</p>
<p>How does this relate to form.</p>
<p>Well, you see more clearly errors when you are thin. So thin dancers,
in a way, have to be even more exacting to achieve a flawless
performance. Likewise, if you are thin you will notice when you are
doing something incorrectly more easily.</p>
<p>At the far extreme, we can imagine someone who is, say 1000 pounds
dancing or training. From this, we can see the truth of the points made
above. They would nearly completely cover space behind them and
therefore would have very little negative space showing if they were to
dance. They would be unable to see little if any of their musculature,
or their skeleton. Would they be able to tell if their shoulder blades
were out of position while performing an upright row? How about if their
arm movements were parallel? Or if their chest muscles were contracting
equally during the downward motion?</p>
<p>As I was saying before, I have difficulty positioning my shoulders.
This is becoming much more obvious as I lose weight, and only now am I
motivated to take careful steps to correct it.</p>
<p>I could probably have stated all of the above in much fewer
words.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, writing is not only about being succinct, but about
communicating a way of thinking natural to the writer.</p>
<p>I give greater access to my mind by not taking too much care to get
it exactly right, like in real conversation.</p>
<p>I hope this is appreciated.</p>
<p>I do see the flip side, but the benefit of giving my mind this way,
without too much editing,</p>
<p>is that you do actually get closer to my mind.</p>
<p>And not a posture.</p>

<h2 id="saving-as-investing."><a name="saving-as-investing">Saving as
Investing.</a></h2>
<p>It is a horrible mistake for people to be convinced,</p>
<p>that if they do not invest,</p>
<p>that they will not end up well off when they get older.</p>
<p>This is because investing is <em>hard</em>.</p>
<p>It involves knowledge and discipline that takes time to acquire.</p>
<p>And some think:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Well I guess I won’t save because I don’t know how to invest”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is a horrible mistake.</p>
<p>First save,</p>
<p>then you will have money to invest!!!</p>
<p>Then only invest,</p>
<p>if you can invest wisely.</p>
<p>Otherwise, you are gambling.</p>
<p>If I could go back in time to when I was 10 years old,</p>
<p>I would get a job of some kind,</p>
<p>and I would save 2/3 of everything I earned,</p>
<p>with the promise that I would never use it.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Eventually, I would start spending more,</p>
<p>but only a little more,</p>
<p>as my pay increased.</p>
<p>If you work out the numbers,</p>
<p>you will be extremely well off,</p>
<p>by the time you have money to invest,</p>
<p>without fail.</p>
<p>Of course, something can always happen to reverse it,</p>
<p>but that won’t be because of anything in your control.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>It appears that for almost all young people,</p>
<p>this advice is impossible to follow,</p>
<p>because of the temptations of spending.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Sure, you only live once.</p>
<p>I would tell myself</p>
<p>live like this is your last day.</p>
<p>I wore a ring that said this.</p>
<p>But then I corrected myself, to remember:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“But it is also probably your first day.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My wedding ring had this meaning, and I wore it on the other
hand.</p>
<p>To remind myself,</p>
<p>that I had a lot of life remaining most likely,</p>
<p>and others to care for.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>There is another perspective,</p>
<p>I would offer to older people,</p>
<p>who did not follow this advice,</p>
<p>but for the time being,</p>
<p>I would advise older people,</p>
<p>to advise younger people,</p>
<p>to take this advice seriously,</p>
<p>and realize it is not about understanding,</p>
<p>it is about self-control.</p>
<p>Remember:</p>
<p>smarter children,</p>
<p>do a better job taking care of their parents,</p>
<p>than children who will make some of the same mistakes,</p>
<p>as their parents.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>There is more to say for this but I will wait for another time.</p>
<p>Except I will say:</p>
<p>Saving is investing in your future self.</p>
<p>Don’t limit your future self,</p>
<p>unless you have a very good reason to do so.</p>

in Education, and Work</a></h2>
<p>When I was a kid, I had no idea how much effort was needed to get an
A. I would either overdo it, or do nothing at all. Today, I put in just
a little effort, and I am surprised about the feedback I get from my
instructors. I got a “Wow” reaction from my professor on a recent paper,
and was told I “<em>definitely</em> think like an empirical economist.”
It made my day, since I did not expect it at all. This was from a highly
respectable professor. I thought I was going to get a “C” for sure. It
always turns out better than I expect. I think back to childhood and
wonder why I cared so much, and why I would prefer an F over imagined
harsh judgment. I became embarrassed way too easily.</p>
<p>Today it seems there are many paths to success. Some would be shocked
to learn that I dropped out of High School, obtained my G.E.D., and took
the longer path. It took a while but I finally made it work for me.
Earlier, when I was in High School, there were fewer chances (I
appreciate the many opportunities we have these days with all sorts of
novel education pathways). At that time, there seemed to be great
emphasis on straight ’A’s. Perhaps it is the same now, and I’m
disconnected, but it is unnecessary. If I had a kid, I would emphasize
speed in education and living life well, over straight As. “Aim at a low
A or B and just get it done”.</p>
<p>In the workforce, all I see are mediocre productions. Yet people
retain their dignity, respect, and their paychecks without much worry or
concern. No one is going after them for sloppy work. Put in your time,
and show some gray hairs, and you will get promoted. Job-hop your way
into higher salaries, if you’re not aging fast enough. Getting praised
for “straight A” type behavior in the workforce is rare. It will
backfire actually. No one wants to work that hard, and they don’t want
to see you working that hard either. They are ready to give you the
equivalent of “A” marks for “D” work, as long as you show up and do
it.</p>

and the Swayed Vote</a></h2>
<p>A whole mass of people revealed their dependence upon information
presented to them as if they were passive players in the vote. They are
active participants, true, but what they revealed is that they can
easily be strategically guided one way or another on the basis of
manipulated information and its presentation. This implies that the
manipulators have insight into how they think, their patterns. Decision
making is just active rule governed bio intelligence applied to problem
solving. The idea is that if all the information is controlled and if
people are well enough understood, then their voting behavior in a sense
isn’t up to them, and is actually predictable. It is becoming more and
more predictable as the information is fine tuned. This supports the
idea that complexity is the only obstacle to predictability. Probability
is just what we use in the absence of information. Micro-scale quantum
indeterminacy cannot help in this ether.</p>

<p>One’s language mastery and availability of resources are intimately
related. No one is going to waste their time on learning aboriginal
languages. Obviously there is a spectrum, so there are other languages
worth avoiding too. Some are more fortunate in their luck in avoiding
unworthy tongues. If not by birth, they avoid it by opportunity. If an
opportunity presents, pouring effort into that opportunity is necessary.
If the opportunity was at birth, pouring all effort into that
opportunity that others take for granted is still probably the best
choice! In other words, maybe you should chase that degree in physics in
Chinese, if you are Mongolian or Chinese, and skip learning Mongolian.
If you speak English, maybe you should stop watching TV and learn some
more English.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Aside: this post is about the value of being in a society with a
large language, versus a society that has a very small language. There
is cultural value in small languages. I do not deny this. But if one has
the opportunity to skip over all the time it takes to master a small
language, or a foreign language one will seldom use, to a low level of
mastery, with no real goal or objective in mind, then one should take
that opportunity to skip it.</p>
<p>We talk about white privilege. Or privilege of the elite. These
privileges include the ability to ignore and overlook other languages,
because the language they learned is already the one everyone considers
to be the most valuable.</p>
<p>So the reality is that they are able to save time, which is
considered all valuable to the most affluent people, while everyone else
needs to struggle to change languages from one that is less desirable to
one that is more desirable. Or to pretend to be a member of the same
culture as the white privileged culture, and not the unprivileged
cultures.]</p>

<p>“Fitting in,” appears to be, in large part, “mutually shared
socially-contextualized pretense.” The goal to exhibit the shared
narrative on required inauthenticities.</p>
<p>This appears to be more important than having actual

<p>People who are concerned with authenticity seem to be really
concerned with enforcing or spreading standards of authenticity. But the
result would just be more attempts at “fitting in.”</p>

<p>Pre-meditation for defense with a gun, has no power compared with

<p>Furthermore, pre-meditation to perform defense with a gun, is very

Tend to Lie, When the Topic is of Great Importance.</a></h2>
<p>This is one reason why taboos exist.</p>
<p>Let’s begin looking into taboos here on the ThoughtStream.</p>
<p>Taboos do not come about only because of shame or embarrassment.</p>
<p>There are other reasons, why subjects end up</p>
<p>excluded</p>
<p>from free communication,</p>
<p>and are actively censored—</p>
<p>suppressing valuable knowledge.</p>
<p>Maybe a useful</p>
<p>first taboo to talk about,</p>
<p>would be</p>
<p>“Why parents lie and why they cannot agree.”</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>“Why your friends parents are more trustworthy,</p>
<p>than yours are.”</p>
<p>Here are a few reasons that come to mind,</p>
<p>why elders lie:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>In our culture, teachers do not admit when they are ignorant
about something</em>. It is rare—frighteningly rare, in my experience,
for a teacher to say, “I don’t know about _______ (something important),
that I feel like I should know, because I’m the teacher”.</li>
<li><em>Parents want their children to be just like them</em>. They
don’t want their children to be like a person who knows more, who might
be different.</li>
<li><em>Parents had false beliefs and expectations, when they had
kids.</em> Before a child is born, they have completely fake ideas about
who their kids will be when they grow up. But they try their best to
force the child to resemble what their hopes were, or continue to
be.</li>
<li><em>Culture disallows certain conversations, because of social
disapproval that would result, if it is found out, that the child is
taught something that differs from community standards.</em> For
example, if you live in a christian culture, you’re supposed to baptise
your child. However, it is not clear that that does anything at all. If
you don’t do it, you might be considered a parent who is willing to send
their child directly to hell. But in reality, maybe you just understand
something they do not. Perhaps they are doing it, in order to continue
doing it.</li>
<li><em>They are not critical thinkers.</em> They are unable to
determine when certain points of view have weaknesses, and when there
are alternatives that are vastly superior, even if they are just
unfamiliar.</li>
</ul>
<p>…</p>
<p>So if a child says,</p>
<p>“I’m afraid to die. What happens when I die?”</p>
<p>You can expect the parent,</p>
<p>instead of saying,</p>
<p>I don’t know,</p>
<p>will pretend,</p>
<p>not only to be unfearful,</p>
<p>but to actually know,</p>
<p>the unknowable.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>And remember,</p>
<p>Since we are all equal,</p>
<p>Or so our elder’s tell us,</p>
<p>we can ask someone else’s parent this question,</p>
<p>and we should trust what they say,</p>
<p>as much as our what our own parents would say.</p>
<p>Even if they have a different religion.</p>
<p>After all,</p>
<p>they would encourage,</p>
<p>other kids,</p>
<p>to listen to their own parents.</p>
<p>Why would they do this,</p>
<p>if they didn’t have good things to teach also.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Think back to when you were a kid,</p>
<p>if you are not now a kid.</p>
<p>What would your friend do,</p>
<p>but listen to their parents,</p>
<p>and not yours?</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Personally,</p>
<p>I think the best choice,</p>
<p>is to listen to people who know,</p>
<p>and not people who don’t,</p>
<p>and it makes no difference,</p>
<p>who that is.</p>
<p>For some,</p>
<p>unfortunately,</p>
<p>it might be better to disregard,</p>
<p>much of what their parents say.</p>
<p>Why do I think this.</p>
<p>Parents utterly despise,</p>
<p>what other parents think.</p>
<p>We can learn about this by watching the news,</p>
<p>on politics and religion,</p>
<p>and it is not easy to find,</p>
<p>ignorant people,</p>
<p>who happened to have children.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>This is a fundamental problem with education.</p>
<p>Children do not get to choose who their parents are.</p>

<h2
id="how-i-inhibited-my-fear-of-death."><a name="how-i-inhibited-my-fear-of-death">How
I Inhibited My Fear of Death.</a></h2>
<p>I am not afraid of death,</p>
<p>although that was not always true.</p>
<p>There were some stages to get through before I arrived at my
answer.</p>
<p>The first step I can recall is getting over my fear of darkness.</p>
<p>This might seem unrelated, but it is not.</p>
<p>So I will discuss getting over this fear first,</p>
<p>after moving on to talk more specifically about fear of death.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>I write this with some reservations,</p>
<p>because people might claim that I have no experience with this.</p>
<p>Of course, who could have experience with it,</p>
<p>without having died, and never returned.</p>
<p>But this is actually not a good objection.</p>
<p>The reason is that what people are trying to get over,</p>
<p>is not fear of death itself,</p>
<p>but a fear they experience,</p>
<p>while they are still living,</p>
<p>imagining something,</p>
<p>that they consider to be related to death,</p>
<p>but as I will share later,</p>
<p>there is no resemblance.</p>
<p>Consider this point,</p>
<p>did you die,</p>
<p>and afterwards confirm,</p>
<p>that what you were fearing,</p>
<p>had any relationship with death at all?</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>I can’t guarantee my approach will work for you,</p>
<p>and I also can’t guarantee that it will work for me,</p>
<p>for my entire life,</p>
<p>because as my brain deteriorates,</p>
<p>I will lose what I know,</p>
<p>and I will lose my discipline,</p>
<p>to the extent,</p>
<p>that I will be a very different person potentially,</p>
<p>than I am now,</p>
<p>much as would happen,</p>
<p>if I suffered a personality altering aneurism,</p>
<p>or if I had severe brain damage.</p>
<p>But for the most part,</p>
<p>we are able to retain what we’ve learned,</p>
<p>up until death,</p>
<p>although many very old people disappear from our view,</p>
<p>so we cannot say to what extent,</p>
<p>they lose who they were before.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Either way, we do not refrain from teaching each other,</p>
<p>for fear that what was taught,</p>
<p>will be lost,</p>
<p>but in this case,</p>
<p>the interesting thing is we die once,</p>
<p>potentially when we are old and did in fact lose all we learned.</p>
<p>This is why any arguments about what someone does on their
deathbed,</p>
<p>as having any value for determining,</p>
<p>what their actual belief system really was,</p>
<p>is simply false.</p>
<p>Doctors and soldiers well acquainted with death,</p>
<p>will testify,</p>
<p>that it is the persons state of mind,</p>
<p>at the time of death,</p>
<p>and the conditions,</p>
<p>that will determine the result.</p>
<p>If grandma has Alzheimer’s,</p>
<p>she might not be able to use,</p>
<p>what she knew before,</p>
<p>not even if what she knew,</p>
<p>was Christian.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>However, what I have to discuss here,</p>
<p>is not really how to prevent fear at the time of death,</p>
<p>although I suspect this will help.</p>
<p>The point of this,</p>
<p>is to have no fear of death,</p>
<p>as long as you are living,</p>
<p>with <em>hopes</em> that the discipline will allow you to</p>
<p>remain unfearful,</p>
<p>when you die,</p>
<p>if you are in a similar disposition,</p>
<p>mentally,</p>
<p>to how you are now.</p>
<p>But how much better would it be,</p>
<p>if you surpass what is mentioned here?</p>
<p>Because I have no claim to having the greatest level</p>
<p>of training on this topic.</p>
<p>I’m self-trained and can only state</p>
<p>what my experiences happen to be.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>So I suspect that what I say here,</p>
<p>will help many who choose to give my approach</p>
<p>a real chance.</p>
<p>Why not give it a chance, right?</p>
<p>Is it not important?</p>
<p>I hope people will take seriously what I have to say about it.</p>
<p>How many people do you know,</p>
<p>who claim to have knowledge on this topic?</p>
<p>Who would your mentor be?</p>
<p>If not for someone who first claims to have something to offer.</p>
<p>Judge for yourself.</p>
<p>Who knows,</p>
<p>maybe others will emerge,</p>
<p>who are also not afraid.</p>
<p>It’s not all about religion.</p>
<p>So you can open your mind to hear suggestions.</p>
<p>Suggestions.</p>
<p>Some have simple and practical answers to these,</p>
<p>supposedly weighty topics.</p>
<p><strong>Weighty for those who are scared!</strong></p>
<p>Maybe easy for those who are not!</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>I hope others open up and explain how they got over it,</p>
<p>but only if they really did.</p>
<p>I really did.</p>
<p>And if this helps you,</p>
<p>Then <em>that is your confirmation</em>,</p>
<p>that I was right.</p>
<p>But it is not confirmation,</p>
<p>that it’s the only way.</p>
<p>This is what the excessively religious will tell you.</p>
<p>Selling you solutions,</p>
<p>only they can provide?</p>
<p>I won’t make this claim.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>When I was a kid I was afraid of the dark.</p>
<p>Upon returning to my bed,</p>
<p>after using the bathroom in the middle of the night,</p>
<p>I would jump from a distance,</p>
<p>so something underneath the bed,</p>
<p>would not be able to reach and grab me,</p>
<p>and pull me underneath,</p>
<p>before I could get on top.</p>
<p>It was irrational.</p>
<p>Maybe I would be eaten? Who knows?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Aside: For some funny reason I didn’t think it would come out from
under the bed while I was sleeping and get me anyway].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was also afraid of the closet, and other dark spaces,</p>
<p>usually because I thought something was inside.</p>
<p>Somehow by becoming dark,</p>
<p>something dangerous would suddenly emerge from inside,</p>
<p>or be transported inside.</p>
<p>Which of course, makes no sense,</p>
<p>especially indoors.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Like other kids I just thought there might be something inside.</p>
<p>But there never was anything inside.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>I have a suspicion that many adults never completely got over their
fear of darkness.</p>
<p>I have strong reasons to think this, but I won’t discuss that
here.</p>
<p>Because that would include telling information about friends and
family,</p>
<p>who don’t necessarily want to share that fear.</p>
<p>There is no reason to be embarrassed if that is true.</p>
<p>I’m talking about <em>really</em> getting over the fear of
darkness,</p>
<p>such that you can roam around in the dark,</p>
<p>at night, without a care.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Although I remember being afraid of the dark inside my house,</p>
<p>I cannot remember a time when I was afraid</p>
<p>to be outside in the woods,</p>
<p>in the darkness.</p>
<p>I probably was.</p>
<p>But since I got over this fear specifically,</p>
<p>to cure my fear of darkness,</p>
<p>all I can recall is not being fearful of it.</p>
<p>I was still a kid when I conquered this fear.</p>
<p>And later I built upon my experience with this.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>How did I achieve do it?</p>
<p>One day,</p>
<p>I imagined myself in the woods,</p>
<p>both during the daylight and during the night time.</p>
<p>If you think about it,</p>
<p>the change from light to darkness does not change anything in the
woods.</p>
<p>The trees don’t change,</p>
<p>and the space is all the same.</p>
<p>Nothing moves from where it was before,</p>
<p>which is why in the morning,</p>
<p>when it is light again,</p>
<p>everything is as it was.</p>
<p>The only difference is that animals that might startle you during the
day,</p>
<p>might be asleep at night,</p>
<p>if they are diurnal (meaning animals that are awake only during the
day).</p>
<p>Other animals might come out,</p>
<p>but where I grew up,</p>
<p>they were all non-threatening.</p>
<p>These were the nocturnal animals.</p>
<p>I was a diurnal animal pretending and imagining myself to be
nocturnal.</p>
<p>In a way,</p>
<p>humans cross over.</p>
<p>After thinking of things this way,</p>
<p>it changed my perspective quickly.</p>
<p>A switch was flipped,</p>
<p>and now,</p>
<p>and forever,</p>
<p>I’m not afraid of the dark.</p>
<p>The trick is to find this mental switch.</p>
<p>First you imagine that everything is the same,</p>
<p>at night,</p>
<p>as during the day…</p>
<p>but then you have to test it with action.</p>
<p>You have to walk around at home in the dark.</p>
<p>You have to go outside in the woods in the dark,</p>
<p>(as long as there is nothing dangerous where you live in the
dark.</p>
<p>It is not wise to roam around in the dark if there are bears,</p>
<p>or other dangerous animals present,</p>
<p>unless you’re trained or experienced enough for that of course).</p>
<p>If I wake up at night, and have to use the bathroom,</p>
<p>I can walk without any light at all,</p>
<p>even in an unfamiliar place,</p>
<p>like a hotel room.</p>
<p>Nothing changed except the light.</p>
<p>I also played outside in the dark in the woods,</p>
<p>as a kid,</p>
<p>without any flashlight and was not scared.</p>
<p>Here, where I live now, in Alaska, I would not be scared to do the
same.</p>
<p>But, I would be scared of being eaten by bears.</p>
<p>And this is very different, however, from being scared of the
dark.</p>
<p>Being scared of the dark, in itself, is not a reasonable fear.</p>
<p>But being scared of what you can reasonably expect to be
dangerous,</p>
<p>in the dark,</p>
<p>is.</p>
<p>It’s more about what is actually present, and what isn’t.</p>
<p>Darkness doesn’t make scary things</p>
<p>spring into existence.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>In some places we should be more scared to be out in the day,</p>
<p>than during the dark.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Well for one,</p>
<p>we are told,</p>
<p>people are more dangerous,</p>
<p>and they are plentiful during the day.</p>
<p>We go and find them to spend time with them!</p>
<p>Even strangers.</p>
<p>But at night,</p>
<p>we are scared of empty space?</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Try out walking all around your home,</p>
<p>at night,</p>
<p>with no light at all.</p>
<p>You don’t need it.</p>
<p>It might just prepare you for understanding partially or completely
blind people as well.</p>
<p>And you get a good sense of orientation and movement in the dark
too.</p>
<p>You don’t need very much light.</p>
<p>Some facts will help you do this easily.</p>
<p>One thing that I learned,</p>
<p>that is related to this,</p>
<p>is that peripheral vision is good at night,</p>
<p>but straight vision is not.</p>
<p>This is because your retina contains “cone” receptors</p>
<p>primarily in areas that are used</p>
<p>when you look straight at something.</p>
<p>You have really good perception of color and detail,</p>
<p>when you look straight at something,</p>
<p>but a more poor sense of color in your peripheral vision.</p>
<p>During the day, this works just fine.</p>
<p>Your vision is designed for this!</p>
<p>But the problem is, you have less “rod” receptors</p>
<p>which help you see things good in black-and-white</p>
<p>and in low light,</p>
<p>when you look straight.</p>
<p>But you have many rod receptors helping your peripheral vision.</p>
<p>So at night, I walk around,</p>
<p>focusing on what I see more towards the corners of my eyes,</p>
<p>and try not to look straight ahead.</p>
<p>If you test this, you’ll see</p>
<p>that when you look straight ahead at night,</p>
<p>it will be almost completely black,</p>
<p>but around the sides of your vision,</p>
<p>you will see light.</p>
<p>But conditions have to be dark enough.</p>
<p>And during the day I do the reverse,</p>
<p>which is what we normally do.</p>
<p>By doing this, you can become much less fearful of the dark,</p>
<p>and you can come to understand blind people,</p>
<p>and prepare yourself for having poorer vision,</p>
<p>when you get older.</p>
<p>Again, notice the point,</p>
<p>that when you get old,</p>
<p>you will not be like how you are now.</p>
<p>You need to be prepared for this.</p>
<p>So just because you get over your fear of death,</p>
<p>does not mean that you will not be fearful,</p>
<p>when you die.</p>
<p>When you get really old,</p>
<p>there is a chance you will lose some of your senses.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>I will resume this soon and talk about the next steps.</p>
<p>I am not going to edit this now,</p>
<p>just in case,</p>
<p>I die and the information is never conveyed.</p>

<p>If it wasn’t entirely apparent,</p>
<p>there is a method in the post below,</p>
<p>To combat our tendency to use false sentences,</p>
<p>using words like most, greatest, best, and so on.</p>
<p>They are usually wrong.</p>
<p>We can see it by simply adding another “-est”.</p>
<p>Bestest.</p>
<p>Greatestest.</p>
<p>Stupidestest.</p>
<p>Strongestest.</p>
<p>Poorestest. Richestest.</p>
<p>I’m trying to use this to train myself to become more accurate,</p>
<p>and it is slowly working.</p>
<p>Do it every single time and you’ll see how frequently it makes you
truthful.</p>
<p>It’s fun.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>We can use it to combat lies of all types we were raised on.</p>
<p>What is the greatest hometown?</p>
<p>Your hometown is the greatestest of course!</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>And we can use it to counter clearly ridiculous movements.</p>
<p>When you’re told you’re the most special, consider that you’re
only</p>
<p>the mostestest special.</p>
<p>“America is the greatestest country.”</p>
<p>The Guiness Book of World’s Records can be converted to</p>
<p>The Guiness Book of World’s Greatestest</p>
<p>(they have no idea).</p>
<p>Unless it’s something clearly confirmable, like the height of the
tallest building.</p>
<p>Smartestest Man or Woman in the world.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>We can use it to break false advertisements.</p>
<p>We can use it to reveal flaws in nationalistic movements.</p>
<p>It counters propaganda effectively.</p>
<p>To counter the propaganda of white supremacists,</p>
<p>from within and from without,</p>
<p>we might <em>insist</em> they say that whites are</p>
<p>the greatestest race, and not merely the greatest.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>We’ll have to practice together to stop making this mistake.</p>

is not very actionable.</a></h2>
<p>If we are honest with ourselves,</p>
<p>how much</p>
<p>does the typical person really know</p>
<p>about history?</p>
<p>How <em>actionable</em> is,</p>
<p>whatever it is,</p>
<p>they think they know?</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Some might know history well enough</p>
<p>to use it,</p>
<p>but it is hard to know,</p>
<p><em>who that is!</em></p>
<p>And if they are involved in politics at all!</p>
<p>I met a few people</p>
<p>well acquainted with history,</p>
<p>who seem to live in imagination,</p>
<p>having very poor judgment as to practical matters,</p>
<p>who are also too religious,</p>
<p>non-philosophical,</p>
<p>and unscientific,</p>
<p>to be trusted to make policy decisions,</p>
<p>for other people.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Example: “Is it worthwhile to create a museum for creationism?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The historian of tall tales,</p>
<p><em>would</em> tell you “Yes it is!”</p>
<p>and millions will be spent,</p>
<p>on artistic exhibits,</p>
<p>that are only artistic,</p>
<p>because they are not historical.</p>
<p>Or they are artistic lessons,</p>
<p>on errors humans tend to make.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>In my opinion,</p>
<p>a sign of a poor leader,</p>
<p>is too much talk about history.</p>
<p>Because more often than not,</p>
<p>they are using it to posture,</p>
<p>more than they would use it,</p>
<p>and certainly more than they <em>could use it</em>,</p>
<p>for successful planning and decision making.</p>
<p>Whenever I hear talk about history,</p>
<p>from a politician,</p>
<p>or anyone really,</p>
<p>I find issues of relevance,</p>
<p>that are not obvious to the person who is relying,</p>
<p>on that history,</p>
<p>to deceive,</p>
<p>perhaps unwittingly,</p>
<p>the people they are trying to persuade.</p>
<p>They enjoy telling the stories,</p>
<p>of things they did not experience,</p>
<p>just like they like telling stories of what they did experience,</p>
<p>for gratification of their impulse,</p>
<p>simply to tell the stories again.</p>
<p>We all know people who do this.</p>
<p>And we are allowed to like them for it too.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>And of the best historians,</p>
<p>who are the best,</p>
<p>at making correct analogies,</p>
<p>with the innumerable causal relationships,</p>
<p>or weak correlations, to make things worse,</p>
<p>between what has happened,</p>
<p>and what is happening.</p>
<p>And what are the methods required,</p>
<p>to do it so well,</p>
<p>that they can <em>forecast with it</em>,</p>
<p>from positions of leadership,</p>
<p>dependent first on placement,</p>
<p>by voter judgments,</p>
<p>certainly not equipped,</p>
<p>with the same profound decision making machinery?</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Whatever it is that leaders are doing,</p>
<p>when they are performing well,</p>
<p>it probably isn’t as dependent on history,</p>
<p>as people think.</p>
<p>By history, I’m not thinking of personal history.</p>
<p>Although personal histories are also questionable,</p>
<p>because people don’t seem to remember their own lives all that
well.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>I say all of this,</p>
<p>completely admitting,</p>
<p>that I’m a student of history,</p>
<p>and still find that knowledge useful,</p>
<p>probably because it has made me understand,</p>
<p>what people do to each other.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>And I also say all this,</p>
<p>while laughing to myself,</p>
<p>because there is fun to be had in scepticism.</p>
<p>I was close to writing,</p>
<p>a promise to include solutions to some of these problems,</p>
<p>or descriptions as to what is best in what currently exists,</p>
<p>but to be as truthful as possible,</p>
<p>I’m trying to avoid such promises and commitments,</p>
<p>although I hope I’m able to actually do something of the sort at some
point in the near future.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Much of this is for my own amusement,</p>
<p>(this post in particular),</p>
<p>and I’m sure other people will enjoy some of this too,</p>
<p>if they are at all like myself.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>We all deserve to enjoy,</p>

id="finding-change-levers-by-creating-public-systems-models"><a name="finding-change-levers-by-creating-public-systems-models">Finding
Change Levers by Creating Public Systems Models</a></h2>
<p>One way to be sure one does not spend too much time dreaming about
how to create social change would be to have public systems models
available that identify where changes are actually possible, and how
much effort is required to make the changes.</p>
<p>Which organizations should provide transparent systems models, and
which should have secret models, or some combination of the two, is not
something I will discuss yet. Instead, let’s consider what would happen
if clear systems models for public systems and other organizations that
are expected to be transparent, actually come into existence.</p>
<p>What is clear is that such systems models are not available for
public consumption currently. At least not systems model diagrams that
provide most of what is needed in an easy to understand medium. One
would have to do considerable research to understand a typical
organization, and it would be nearly impossible to discover where
transparencies exist, and where they do not. Systems model diagrams
would provide most of what is needed for quick comprehension. This would
certainly be beneficial and would provide a <em>standardized way</em>
for understanding and interacting with organizations.</p>
<p>What would creating public systems models achieve?</p>
<p>Firstly, it would convert activists and politicians who are somewhat
aimless in their work, following dead-end pathways, to people who have
clear goals connected with the reality of the systems they are working
with.</p>
<p>Even high level politicians don’t have the resources to fully
understand their own organizations. And this is apparent when listening
to them speak on television.</p>
<p>One thing I have noticed, is that people fail to recognize just how
ambiguous the systems they are working with are, for lack of
understanding, and for lack of insider knowledge.</p>
<p>Or for lack of “insider knowledge” knowledge.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Lack of knowledge about how organizations work, relates to consumer
reactions to business policies and procedures, making Twitter and other
comment-based feedback systems places where little more than attitudes
are conveyed. We would not turn to Twitter for a good understanding of
organizations and their change levers (including policy change levers).
In other words, Twitter is much like a voting box. It is likely to
contain information about peoples likes and dislikes, but not so much
knowledge about proper operation of a complex organizational system.</p>
<p>Secondly, in connection with the first, voters, activists and leaders
would have actionable knowledge about political systems, for having
knowledge about the systems themselves. Furthermore, they would have an
understanding of what it takes to change the systems themselves, since
levers identified wouldn’t simply be those that permit working from the
inside of an institution or organization out, but also working from the
outside in, from the top down, and whatever other ways that might
actually make envisioned changes possible. Or <em>realistic</em>!</p>
<p>What does this also do? This would make it so that people don’t waste
their time in politics, or on political issues, when they could be doing
something they understand more fully. Some things that would bring
themselves tangible rewards, like money. Otherwise, they would not only
be working on something they do not understand, they would be clogging
the system up, because processes would have to be in place to please
them, that would create inefficiencies in the systems that could be
designed for better aims. Consumers need to be satisfied in ways that
make sense to their experience and the exchange they are making with the
businesses; but it is not good for organizations to have to spend time
countering activists who are completely ignorant about how their
business works, or how any organization in general would work.</p>
<p>Thirdly, we would then have folks who could vote and analyze policies
appropriately, because they fully understand the systems in which they
are civically participating. This means it is possible for people to
change from a mere attitude communicator, or voter, to a person who is
actually educated enough to influence policy by adding new and relevant
information.</p>
<p>Would you want to spend your time trying to change an organization in
a way that is costly for society and would never actually succeed?</p>
<p>As things are now, we have to do things that won’t succeed in order
to get the knowledge about organizations required, to ultimately
succeed, but that is a symptom of the problem of not having the
knowledge required about organizations to find the right buttons to push
to make the changes happen.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>These are ideas stemming from a course I took at Harvard University,
in their Extension Program, on Systems Thinking. Ideas like these are
used in business school, so that leaders will have a better
understanding on how to steer and transform their organizations. So
there is nothing in this idea that is not already well supported in
higher education and academia.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Aside: To a large extent, you do not need the Harvard course if you
understand what I just wrote above. Instead, you can search books on
Systems Thinking, and Systems Modeling, and Learning Organizations, and
you will find texts that will guide you in exactly the same ways that
Harvard students are being guided. If you are a leader, or someone who
wants to understand organizations and their change potential more
completely, then I would suggest reading these books. And if you are
interested enough, you may want to take courses as well.</p>
<p>Either way, I hope that organizations have folks you understand this
well enough to make the systems models and to publish them so people can
understand how organizations really be influenced.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One last comment. I think it is important to be totally truthful in
publications about these systems, including showing ways they could
potentially be overthrown by force and by civil disobedience. As I said
above, even if fundamental change is necessary, there should be ways
that that can be done, and that needs to be depicted or made clear, even
if it is something that is uncomfortable or something that people would
not wish to discuss (How else would we be able to connect systems and
institutions with history, which included periodic warfare and social
uprisings to make change? If we are open and candid about this, we might
be more imaginative in the future, even if we have no knowledge about
history. Because if we are honest, how much does anyone really know
about history?).</p>

<h2
id="alternative-grading-methodologies."><a name="alternative-grading-methodologies">Alternative
Grading Methodologies.</a></h2>
<p>Competition on a national level for entry into the university system
creates constraints around what exactly can change in grading
methodology within public schools.</p>
<p>This is unfortunate since it is clear that alternative systems would
be preferable, but the potential for making changes, due to lack of
clear “levers of change”, are unavailable (Where are the switches you
can flip to actually influence it?). It would be desirable to understand
the education system and how such changes could be made or <em>made
possible</em>. Without the right levers, any work to make changes in the
education system could be pointless. The levers have to be identified
one way or another. (See the <a
href="#finding-change-levers-by-creating-public-systems-models">above
comment</a> for more on this idea).</p>
<p>So… what is the alternative grading methodology I have in mind?</p>
<p>While taking tests, in high school and in college, I sometimes
wondered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I just learned from this test, and the errors I made. So why is my
grade not now higher, for having increased my understanding to what was
expected.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once I spent time trying to come up with an alternative system, but I
don’t believe I have that document any longer to share it here.</p>
<p>But today, my main thought is that education should not be about
containing subjects into quarters and semesters, and years, with final
grades at the end, but rather, a system of working kids through subjects
by repeatedly testing and re-testing them for proficiency, allowing them
to learn from previous mistakes on tests, to repeat mistakes until
competency is met.</p>
<p>Because what is the point other than to gain competency quickly? The
goal is not to get an “A” at the very end of the year after taking a
test, but potentially, to master a subject in any amount of time it
takes to master that subject, and then to move on. For some a course
that might take two years and for others it might take two weeks. It
would also allow people to identify weaknesses and to abandon certain
topics entirely, to take courses where their strengths lie instead, and
to maximize those areas where they are strong while they are still
young. Why should they have to wait until after their education is
finished to learn what they are truly good at?</p>
<p>A system such as this would:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make grading unnecessary. It would be about finishing a topic.</li>
<li>Competition would be about how many topics are mastered. This would
allow kids who sit in courses day-dreaming about why they are there, to
switch over to students who are continually stimulated and are able to
learn things to mastery while they are very young.</li>
<li>Interdisciplinary mastery is possible. Children can be led to
college level mastery of topics while they are still young. With the
time gained, they can switch to other topics and gain mastery in those
topics as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think this is a good system for making the changes that are
possible to get to even better systems that allow for merging
disciplines together into “problem first” systems of learning, where
children guide themselves to mastery in areas that they are interested
in.</p>
<p>Such a self-guided system could result in children driving forward
innovation, because even young children are capable of finding problems
that have no solutions, or finding for themselves solutions that might
already exist (it makes no difference if it was already found or
not–what matters is the problem solving. Finding a solution to a problem
that already has a solution does not make it less innovative, because it
is as innovative, or nearly as innovative, as the process undertaking
the first time). By doing this, children unearth the process that is
required to do real things in the world, by encountering obstacles.</p>
<p>The teacher then is a remover of obstacles, rather than someone who
is supposed to know everything already.</p>
<p>I first mentioned this idea to an intern and a fellow attendee at the
COFES event in Phoenix in 2018 (Congress on the Future of Software
Engineering), and received good feedback. I think we all want mentors
who will show us the way to realize our own goals, and if we receive
this, it is incredibly meaningful and is something we do not forget.</p>
<p>I have a few teachers in mind who were maybe life-saving, and will
always remember what they did for me, and they were closer to this way
of doing things, although the system did not allow them to fully teach
according to this style (and they may not agree that this is the best
approach anyhow).</p>

<p>The change required is not only to change the way we use our language

them?</p>

<p>What works exist that have not made these errors?</p>

defects?</p>
<p>And which texts suffer from them the most?</p>
<p>The most ancient texts— how would they fare?</p>
<p>How far were they from understanding logic?</p>
<p>This brings us to challenge two:</p>
<p><em>Challenge Two</em></p>
<p>Find a text of at least 200 pages that does not commit the errors
listed in challenge one.</p>
<p>And remember we were only considering <em>two</em> logically risky
words.</p>
<p>Once we get to a more full treatment of logic, that most readers will
be able to understand clearly, we’ll find,</p>
<p>that everything is defective.</p>
<p>And then you might be more forgiving,</p>
<p>of errors you find,</p>
<p>here in the ThoughtStream,</p>
<p>and in your own ThoughtStream,</p>
<p>and you’ll see the importance of logic,</p>
<p>and creating true and meaningful statements,</p>
<p>and arguments,</p>
<p>over editing punctuation.</p>

moral,</p>

the urge to finish things the result of the escalation of commitment

<p>“Cut your losses” is a common expression, but it seems to be less
popular than “Complete what you started”.</p>
<p>“Cut your losses” seems to be the better phrase of the two, because
at least it implies that one can make the decision,</p>
<p>to stop something,</p>
<p>if it no longer makes sense to continue any longer.</p>
<p>“Complete what you started”, is not the opposite of the first
phrase.</p>
<p>“Complete what you started if it still makes sense to complete it.”
would be closer.</p>
<p>“Retain your gains.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>I enjoy the heap of expressions we have in our culture,</p>
<p>because there are so many problems with it.</p>
<p>Which item in the heap do we grab when?</p>
<p>Why does it seem that for any one piece of advice, there is an
opposite piece of advice for the same situation?</p>
<p>There is no rule book about which principle to follow at any given
time.</p>
<p>People who are biased towards completing things will grab the one
about completing things.</p>
<p>Those who are biased against continuing projects that look like money
pits will choose the other.</p>
<p>But what is clear to me, is that it is foolish to follow either of
these pieces of advice.</p>
<p>Instead it is better to replace it with the idea that if something is
amiss, it is worth re-evaluating with</p>
<p><em>thinking…</em></p>
<p><em>and not just </em>remembering**,</p>
<p>so long as re-evaluating with thinking itself, wouldn’t be too
costly.</p>
<p>This alone should show that it is really tricky to know whether or
not it is worth completing something once one has already started.</p>
<p>How many times in a project/plan, should the project/plan itself be
re-evaluated in this way? And when?</p>
<p>“Stick to the plan” includes the same defective thinking.</p>
<p>If it were easy to know the answer, then wouldn’t we find that there
are few failures?</p>
<p>Because projects would be completed successfully or else they would
be abandoned at the right time.</p>
<p>From this we can see that no principle is really all that useful for
guiding us in complex decisions of this sort, and that we are better
off, having an alternative way to make decisions under uncertainty, that
involves the actual weighing of options. And tracking of options.</p>
<p>But most are not studying game theory, and there is no clear way to
put this into practice at present.</p>
<p>And we are even further away from admitting that pieces in the
heap,</p>
<p>are ready to be thrown into the fire,</p>
<p>and replaced with something new,</p>
<p>because no one is tracking the heap,</p>
<p>or potential replacements,</p>
<p>and even if replacements were known,</p>
<p>how would they be taught to replace what’s in the heap?</p>
<p>Since the way that we learn what’s in the heap,</p>
<p>is by punctuated accidents of experience, over large portions of our
lifetimes.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>And so we go with the judgment of experience,</p>
<p>with the next problem,</p>
<p>that experience differs,</p>
<p>in what it thinks should be done under almost any circumstances.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>And this is another reason why I love philosophy. In philosophy we
are permitted to question received notions, and from the above, it
should be clear, that received blurbs are not so useful as we might
think, and that instead, there are better approaches that are more
eclectic and are less biased, that include reasoning and not just
recollection.</p>

Justice and Understanding What Justice Actually Is.</a></h2>
<p>A mostly optimal process for arriving at a just solution model to
implement for correcting a particular set of related social problems,
shared openly and transparently, would be one that would be mostly
agreeable to any citizen who analyses it independently, if they are
equipped to fully understand and appreciate the process, and the social
justice criteria used to judge it. As time goes on, and as justice is
improved, our ability to analyse the systems for unfairness, and other
issues, would create a larger and larger burden on individuals in terms
of their mental capabilities, talents, level of education, and ability
to understand and use tools for the purposes—tools that themselves could
be flawed.</p>
<p>Therefore increased justice creates the issue of a greater inability
to analyse the system for injustices, even when it is done well.</p>
<p>When it is done well, the level of detail is so great, that it will
be hard to understand why it is done well, and where the errors are.</p>
<p>Thus we may end up giving up understanding exactly what justice is as
we get far along in the process. One thing can be certain, it is
simplicity in the idea of “equality” that has kept it around so far.
Once we get to an improved sense of justice, based on real situations
and real human and animal diversity, we will find ourself wanting to get
more and more detailed, to the point where not everyone will be able to
analyse the system or understand exactly why it is just or unjust,
unless we are willing to start engineering humans, each and every one,
to be able to comprehend what justice evolves to be.</p>
<p>In our state of simplicity now, have you noticed, that no one can
pinpoint what is actually fair in any given situation?</p>
<p>This is because we have not yet taken the leap to see people in all
their diversity and situations in all their detail, to see what is
optimal in terms of human well-being and satisfaction, that itself also
has not been determined clearly in terms of criteria connecting to
individual differences.</p>

party does a business decision belong to?</a></h2>
<p>I asked an old friend this recently when I was explaining my
perspective regarding the 2-party system in the United States.</p>
<p>I think it is a clear and succinct way to show that situations are
not better understood through any kind of party system.</p>
<p>Party systems do not facilitate understanding of problem situations
and their solution models.</p>
<p>If you were to vote for a business decision as an employee of a
company, would you search for truth through a party system?</p>
<p>Or would you do what you actually do–</p>
<p>simply look for an answer that makes sense to you,</p>
<p>by examining the problem situation,</p>
<p>and then look at the recommended solution to compare?</p>
<p>While at work we do not think about how a party would influence our
decisions.</p>
<p>And this should indicate, how ridiculous the party system really is,
because if it were to be added, it would not do anything to improve the
answer or the outcome.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>A good system model for a problem situation and a good solution model
or policy would have nothing to do with voter party commitments, and
would not be better understood by dividing the topic into a pre-existing
team framework, where the teams are opposed by default.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is hard to say how bite-sized chunks of information
from the media, from already opposed viewpoints, would be of any benefit
to the U.S. or any other nations worldwide.</p>
<p>Such models probably do not even exist, and even if they did, people
would not look at them before deciding how to vote. Because the parties
already decide for folks how to vote, and who to vote for (not solutions
to problems, but people, who never show clearly any models or policy
solutions themselves!).</p>
<p>Then couples vote jointly, forgetting that they would vote
differently if remarried, and then their children are expected to vote
like their parents and not someone else’s parents.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-trivial"><a name="what-is-trivial">What is
Trivial?</a></h2>
<p>I find that one great difference between people who are highly
intelligent and who are not, involves the appreciation for what is not
trivial in apparently mundane things.</p>
<p>Fools will seldom find anything of interest in things that are
seemingly well understood in our everyday experiences.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Aha! There is something new in this supposedly familiar thing.
Something went undetected! And it affects many other things… I find this
worthy of investigation.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a common experience of the scientist or the intelligent
person who finds a new pattern.</p>
<p>When we learn as children, we depend on curiosity and surprise. New
things surprise us, and we pay attention. We focus on these new things,
until we understand them well enough that nothing in them surprises us
any longer. Later it is almost as if we never learned it anything new to
begin with, and we move on to other more interesting, surprising
things.</p>
<p>There comes a point, in adulthood, when we take most of our everyday
experience for granted, such that nothing really seems surprising any
longer, and we need to search harder for novelties and curiosities, in
order to recreate the youthful experience of surprise, and to continue
learning.</p>
<p>Very smart children are hard to satisfy, because they so quickly get
everything they need from almost every experience they have.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Now, what I want to focus on for the moment, is the significance of
this period of high familiarity.</p>
<p>Some people will get stuck in this high familiarity, and cast aside
anything that seems to have been previously considered, as unworthy of
reconsideration.</p>
<p>But people who are especially insightful, observant, or intelligent,
will continue to find surprising things even among what is superficially
trivial and mundane, and this creates an obstacle to communication, with
people who are unwilling, or are unable, to get past the feeling that
they already understand the topic well enough to give up the idea that
they are already an expert concerning it.</p>
<p>My personal interest is moral philosophy. Unfortunately for me,
everyone thinks they are so well acquainted with morality and ethics,
that they have nothing else to learn about it; that there can be no
authority other than the authorities they have accepted; that there is
nothing new to learn in basic human interactions. I’ve known this for a
while, but I’m so intensely interested in the topic that I will not give
it up as my primary area of interest. Because morality addresses topics
that are ever present to everyone all the time, and so, there is great
difficulty in convincing adults, who are not already familiar with a
philosophical treatment of topics, that there is anything new to
discover, or that there is anything that cannot be put aside as already
well covered, in some familiar source, like the Bible or other respected
and probably ancient text. At the same time, since it is a topic that
affects everyone, it is one that is very important, because if a new
discovery is found, it can be expected to change a very large amount of
what we think we already knew about the topic, and ultimately, if the
observation is correct, it should result in a change of behavior for
large populations of people.</p>
<p>So I’m interested in it because of the potential impact, and this
make it worthwhile to study, even if people think they actually already
understand the topic well enough that they don’t need to consider my
findings.</p>
<p>And this is another point. Ancient texts are respected in this
domain, because the topic is <em>so</em> mundane, that there is a
belief, that it was already well enough treated 2,000 years ago, that we
cannot make observations, or discover new facts, that would completely
disrupt our current paradigm of thought on the topic, which would
require an overhaul of our ancient thinking.</p>
<p>I’m reminded of heliocentrism and its impact upon its discovery. And
the risks that came along with the study of Astronomy, since people
thought that was already well understood, and it was built into a moral
framework that was thought to be at risk if there were any changes.</p>
<p>At the moment, I’m not sure there is a way around this.</p>
<p>Why? It seems that an appreciation for learning depends on built-in
surprise capabilities. One has to be able to detect something that is
surprising in order to be able to feel surprised, and therefore curious
enough about it, to learn from the experience.</p>
<p>Also, it is hard know for sure when we’ve analyzed something
thoroughly enough to know if <em>some other topic</em> will not have
general relationships with the well examined topic, such that the
seemingly well examined topic would not need reconsideration. Like
mathematics, logic, and human equality, for example (people think it is
well understood that people are equal and are unwilling to receive new
information on this topic that would create a need for some serious
overhaul in moral and political thinking). The reconsideration could
require a new way of looking at the topic, implying another psychology,
that is an evolution from the previous way of looking at it. And it is
hard to know if such a new perspective would resemble the previous
perspective in ways that we would expect.</p>
<p>I’m sure someone will say they can summarize topic more briefly, but
I assure you, they were not interested in summarizing it, until they
read what I wrote here. So I’m not to concerned about receiving that
sort of criticism concerning the ThoughtStream, since it’s another
attempt, to cast something aside, as something already completely
familiar. You should not be dissuaded by such criticisms, when you find
something of interest, in something another person thinks is already
well understood, because there isn’t a good reason to let the other
thwart your interests and curiosities.</p>

One: Say “Best” or “Worst”, only when it results in a true
statement.</a></h2>
<p>“Best” and “Worst” are <em>logically risky</em> words,</p>
<p>because they so predictably result in sentences that are either</p>
<ul>
<li>Fallacious, or just plain</li>
<li>false.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once these words are heard or spoken,</p>
<p>it is safe to assume the resulting sentence is going to be false,</p>
<p>especially when the number of objects for comparison are large.</p>
<p>Very often the comparison is large—especially when we are comparing
people, or things connected to social life (foods that are best or
worst, least or most healthy, etc..).</p>
<p>Words that frequently create false sentences.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Best</li>
<li>Worst</li>
<li>Always</li>
<li>Never</li>
<li>Everyone</li>
<li>No one</li>
</ol>
<p>The “-est” words:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Stupidest</li>
<li>Smartest</li>
<li>Strongest</li>
<li>Weakest</li>
<li>and so on…</li>
</ol>
<p>A complete list of words having similar underlying logical structures
would be very large, but the reader should be able to easily find
examples in the course of everyday conversation, to find other issues
with creating truthful sentences.</p>
<p><em>The Challenge:</em></p>
<p>Pay attention to when you use the words “best” and “worst” and try to
see if from now on, you can consistently use these words (or
<em>skip</em> using them) to make sentences that are completely true,
and not false.</p>
<p>See how long it takes for you to have success,</p>
<p>and while doing so,</p>
<p>count precisely how often these words spring to mind,</p>
<p>creating sentences that are definitely false.</p>
<p>As you have success, you’ll begin to see, just how serious the
problem is,</p>
<p>since it goes unchecked on television,</p>
<p>in most forms of entertainment,</p>
<p>and advertisement,</p>
<p>and pervades Western English culture, and cultures with similar
tendencies.</p>
<p>This will lead you to observe, as I have, that it is very difficult
to create truthful utterances—and we are only looking at <em>just
two</em> risky words in this challenge!</p>
<p>…</p>
<h3 id="difficulties-to-expect">Difficulties to Expect</h3>
<p>Here are some issues making it difficult to have success with a
seemingly easy task like this one:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><em>Habit and Automaticity</em>
<ul>
<li>You will keep wanting to automatically use these words to create
false sentences.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Frequency</em>
<ul>
<li>It will happen so often, in so many different types of situations,
it will be hard to correct issues each and every time.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Peer pressure</em>
<ul>
<li>It is easy to be re-taught to do it the wrong way, because of how
often it is used incorrectly in our environment. Friends, family,
colleagues, and other people we talk with daily will not be trying to
make the corrections you will be trying to make… <em>[Consider the full
implications of that, and consider the near permanence of this problem,
since it is built into the way we use our language. The change required
is actually to change the way we use our language in speech and in
thought itself! Because how did you arrive at false sentences, without
first thinking them? How did you arrive at them as a destination? It
wasn’t just falsity along the way, it was falsity at the end of the
path!]</em>. They may not see the problem at all. People will use these
words and then expect you to accept their false statements as truths,
and you will find yourself complying with their expectations, by not
openly disagreeing with them. Otherwise you will be correcting people
too frequently, you’ll find.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Unpredictability</em>
<ul>
<li>Practice opportunities occur at unexpected times and places, often
after mistakes have already been made, or when one is not in the right
state of mind to avoid old habits.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>No training</em>
<ul>
<li>There is no training program that currently exists to teach people
to avoid creating false statements. Thus learning depends on remembering
to practice as issues arise, and this is not an easy thing to do!</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Pervasiveness</em>
<ul>
<li>If you are successful in changing your way of thinking, you will
find, over time, if you are not careful, that typical usage in the
larger culture, through entertainment and normal socialization, will
cause your improvements will be eroded, so that your thinking and your
speech will come to resemble what it was before you started. I currently
find myself in this predicament, for lack of maintenance over a several
years. So not only is it challenging update ones linguistic tendencies
to avoid saying things that are false, it is hard to maintain
improvements, after they are painstakingly practiced to mastery. Trust
me, you will be practicing alone, and once you are done practicing,
others around you will not understand that you’ve made improvements.
Instead, they will try to drag you back down to where you were
before.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>When one really sees how many aspects of our language and culture
contribute to forming incorrect sentences, one realizes just how hard it
is to be entirely truthful.</p>
<p>In short: even when you know what the problems are, it is very
difficult to change yourself, so that you can consistently avoid even
simple logical errors.</p>
<p>We will continue to see reasons here in the ThoughtStream and
elsewhere in my writings.</p>
<h3 id="key-problems">Key Problems</h3>
<p>There are many similar words to those listed above, that have the
same effect, and this relates to key problems, that I did not mention
already above.</p>
<ul>
<li>They are used about people or things that are part of a large group
in which not every individual has been measured or even looked at,
and</li>
<li>There is a strong desire to assume that the object or person in
consideration would, after measurement, fall on one of the two poles,
while a spectrum has an infinite number of positions between poles (and
there are no poles, aside from those objects or individuals that are
measured to be the furthest on both sides of the measure. Very often
there can be no assumptions about a minimum or maximum. Poles exist in
the sense that these maximums and minimums create current limits in a
scatter plot that maps to an infinite line pointing in both
directions.)</li>
<li>Oftentimes what is measured is a collection of items or aspects of
objects that should be individually measured. This results in an issue
of summarizing the data in aggregate, because it will not be clear how
the different measures combine to make a total measure. It will be hard
to know if an aggregate summary is even appropriate (consider trying to
determine who the greatest athlete might be, for example, without
admitting that one is merely taking measured strengths in a variety of
areas and somehow arbitrarily combining them to determine who is
greatest in total). This last point indicates that the questions that we
try to answer are also faulty. Why would we be so inclined to find the
very best athlete among a group of athletes, instead of say, trying to
find ways that each athlete excels in comparison with the others, on
specific areas of measurable performance?</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, these issues relate to incorrect generalizations, or
incorrect results or summaries about incomplete data (or errors about
assuming that data even exists). It is tempting to think that only one
or two errors are involved in this type of mistake, but there are many
ways that this type of falsity arises.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>On the plus side, once we are aware of risky words like those above,
we can quickly infer that the statements are incorrect when these words
are used. Although we do need to actually look and not simply guess that
the sentences are false.</p>
<p>On the negative side, these words cloud our judgement and fill our
thinking with falsities, that are hard to remove.</p>
<p>A fundamental issue with Western Culture involves the desire to rank
everyone and everything on a hierarchy.</p>
<p>We are very quick to say that someone or something is the best, or
worst, highest or lowest, greatest or least, without realizing that
almost anytime we make such a claim, we are actually saying something
false.</p>
<p>Also notice, that this tendency, points to the human assumption about
inequality between things and people. The fact that we so quickly think
of things as best and worst, greatest and least, and so on, shows that
we are very quick to dispose of any assumption that there is equality in
a group. It speaks to our desire to get away from equalities in a
panoply of ways, and to our desire to celebrate people and things that
are quite distant from what would result in an equal measure with most
other things. We are continually seeking to be amazed by things that are
<em>maximally unequal</em> to what is most common or normal in groups of
things.</p>

<h2 id="you-are-funny."><a name="you-are-funny">“You are
funny”.</a></h2>
<p>I saw part of an interview with Maya Angelou once.</p>
<p>She said “You are funny”.</p>
<p>It was directed to everyone.</p>
<p>But the way she said it was confusing to me though.</p>
<p>It didn’t really fit into the conversation naturally.</p>
<p>She had a special message to share.</p>
<p>After detecting something was different in her meaning,</p>
<p>or after detecting another interesting perspective,</p>
<p>she probably also intended,</p>
<p>it left a bug in my mind that had to be resolved.</p>
<p>There was some gap that needed to be filled because I couldn’t
understand it fully.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Aside: See <a href="#the-thoughtstream-is-terse">The ThoughtStream
is Terse</a>. This explains that she could fill a gap that <em>I could
not fill</em> until later.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Later, I filled the gap.</p>
<p>Maybe not with exactly what she had in mind, but something close.</p>
<p>Or at least I arrived at the alternative meaning I detected.</p>
<p>“You are funny”.</p>
<p>to me also meant:</p>
<p>“Everyone is a joke”.</p>
<p>(“You are a joke” directed at every person on earth).</p>
<p>I don’t think she was only trying to say that every person had a
sense of humor.</p>
<p>I think she was trying to say everyone can be ludicrous or amusing.
…</p>
<p>I took being called ridiculous, or absurd, or imperfect, in <em>in
the kindest possible way.</em></p>
<p>Because we take ourselves too seriously.</p>
<p>The moment we let go,</p>
<p>we allow ourselves to see that “everyone can make fun of everything
else in the world”,</p>
<p>including all people in it too.</p>
<p>No matter how perfect you think you are,</p>
<p>you are self conscious,</p>
<p>until you see that others will always detect funny things about
you.</p>
<p>So her meaning, is a blunt one,</p>
<p>delivered in a hidden way,</p>
<p>that once discovered,</p>
<p>can change your life for the better forever.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Some might say that is all obvious.</p>
<p>But let me tell you something:</p>
<p>I haven’t learned it yet.</p>
<p>Not completely.</p>
<p>It takes a lot to let go of the fact that certain imperfections you
have,</p>
<p>or actions you’ve taken,</p>
<p>are going to allow people to make fun of you forever.</p>
<p>And that is OK.</p>
<p>But how long will it take to figure out how to feel OK about
that?</p>
<p>A very long time.</p>
<p>Famous people and politicians might not ever get over it
themselves.</p>
<p>But there is tremendous relief in what she said,</p>
<p>if it gets used for self-help.</p>
<p>Because it becomes funny to you too,</p>
<p>eventually,</p>
<p>when you start to see,</p>
<p>that you are funny in the ways that other people see you are
funny.</p>
<p>And you can really just laugh at yourself,</p>
<p>and brush it off,</p>
<p>without even brushing it off.</p>
<p>You laugh it off.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>That is why I posted before:</p>
<p><a href="#give-me-time-ill-help-put-your-mind-at-ease">Give me
time</a></p>
<p>And also why I also posted:</p>
<p><a href="#when-you-dont-know-what-youre-witnessing">When you don’t
know what you’re witnessing</a></p>
<p>Because I didn’t understand Maya Angelou,</p>
<p>Until I did later.</p>
<p>I didn’t need help from her later works,</p>
<p>but sometimes you need to give others time,</p>
<p>to fully express themselves,</p>
<p>before you can judge.</p>
<p>Because they have good intentions,</p>
<p>even when you can’t tell.</p>
<p>And I make that mistake all the time.</p>
<p>Every single day.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>She is an artist in her literature.</p>
<p>and in her life,</p>
<p>Just like I am an artist,</p>
<p>in my writing,</p>
<p>and in my philosophy,</p>
<p>and in my religion,</p>
<p>and in my life too.</p>
<p>And you should consider if you can be an artist also.</p>
<p>Because there is</p>
<p><em>NO LIMIT TO HOW MANY ARTISTS THERE CAN BE ON THIS EARTH!</em></p>
<p>And you don’t need to feel like you’re even good at it,</p>
<p>to get the rewards from it.</p>

<p>What does that mean?</p>
<p>It means that you,</p>

<p>A novel goes through thousands of edits,</p>

<p>…</p>
<p>I think of Charles Darwin’s <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Origin_of_Species"><em>Origin
of the Species</em></a>.</p>
<p>It has six editions.</p>
<p>The first is cherished, and so is the last, final work.</p>
<p>Both are masterpieces, but are quite different from each other.</p>
<p>So we do have information about how one draft started,</p>
<p>and how it developed.</p>
<p>But it would be much better,</p>
<p>if we could have seen the entire production from his hands,</p>
<p>from beginning to end,</p>
<p>than to merely have his six editions,</p>
<p>and have no idea,</p>
<p>how much work,</p>
<p>went into its creation,</p>
<p>from the time he stared writing,</p>
<p>until the time he put his pen down for good.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>This would be version control for writing and art,</p>
<p>preserving the entire creative process,</p>
<p>and all of the edits,</p>
<p>in a way that is useful to a student,</p>

<p>to be missing something that they have,</p>
<p>that you don’t,</p>
<p>and the other way around.</p>
<p>So if you know prayer, <em>do not discount meditation</em>.</p>
<p>and ask yourself, <em>“Why is it called prayer and not
meditation?”</em></p>

<p>…</p>
<p>OK… but why would anyone want to do this?</p>

ThoughtStream is Enough.</a></h2>
<p>Maybe we don’t need any other writing but the ThoughtStream.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>I considered this while I was thinking of responding to a portion of
Peter Strawson’s article “Freedom and Resentment.” I saw some issues in
an argument and thought to myself: “Do I really need to hold myself
back, and wait to write my book—or should I just go ahead, and start
recording these thoughts directly into the ThoughtStream, already
ready?” The ThoughtStream, makes it possible, to record these thoughts,
without worry about how a more sophisticated journal article would be
prepared. In the end, the ideas are what matter. If I were to spend
excess time constructing an article, full of perfect references, the
idea might never get expressed.</p>
<p>This is not to say that articles are not worthwhile for full
presentation of ideas that need serious consideration, and should be a
part of a peer reviewing process.</p>
<p>A journal requires quality.</p>
<p>Encyclopedia Brittanica.</p>
<p>The ThoughtStream does not require quality.</p>
<p>But quality can go into the ThoughtStream.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>There is quality in the existence of the ThoughtStream that contains
even lack of quality.</p>
<p>Because it is the evidence of the mind-being-the-mind.</p>
<p>Why do we not say the brain is holy?</p>
<p>The ThoughtStream is holy?</p>
<p>The animal is holy…</p>
<p>This is a ThoughtStream of an animal.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Maybe we don’t need any other writing but the ThoughtStream.</p>
<p>…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Aside: I know this needs qualification, and I would not want to
dispose of the arts. I would not want to eliminate alternative modes of
communication. On the contrary, I want these to exist. I want new forms
to be created. Nevertheless, the ThoughtStream is complete in many
respects. Imagine if Twitter were extended to include much more lengthy
postings. In that case, everyone could publish more complex writings,
like articles, with references, in addition to the short blurbs, and the
thoughts, in the end, would be in the catalog of writings, from the one
person that produced them. In this sense, everyone can become published,
and everyone can have their life recorded, and everyone can own their
own content, and share it to a degree.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>…</p>
<p>The ThoughtStream makes impacts without explanations. But sometimes
explanations will be added.</p>
<p>At that time or later.</p>
<p>I do not wish to block the creative process.</p>
<p>My thoughts about edits being “blockers” on creativity, and on the
importance of sharing ideas in writing, as if it were open conversation
(since we allow errors in verbalisms), connects with the views of other
creatives, as evidenced by “The Spark”, found in Questlove’s book
<em>Creative Quest</em>. Questlove is extremely interconnected with
creatives and is a SME on the creative process. In many ways that
chapter touches on this same material I’m adding here.</p>
<p>So if you do not think that you will be able to record an idea in an
article,</p>
<p>or in a finished book,</p>
<p>why not simply publish it on a ThoughtStream?</p>
<p>Twitter is not enough for this.</p>
<p>Postings are too short and they may not really be yours.</p>
<p>The journal is a ThoughtStream of sorts.</p>
<p>But the ThoughtStream is open to the world.</p>
<p>It does not matter if we call it the ThoughtStream.</p>
<p><a
href="christopher-matthew-cavanaugh-ThoughtStream.html#zen-doesnt-care-what-you-call-it">Zen
doesn’t care what you call it.</a></p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Consider this an open-sourcing of one of my life goals. To produce my
writings in such a way that I own them, but that other people can have
access to them too, so that all my ideas, that are otherwise very
difficult to share, due to expectations about prep time, actually do get
shared.</p>
<p>The ThoughtStream will dramatically increase in output,</p>
<p>if I’m allowed my artistic freedom,</p>
<p>and there is freedom from interference.</p>
<p>At the moment, I don’t have freedom from interference.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>I hope everyone else gets to own their own ThoughtStream.</p>

Models in Daily Life.</a></h2>
<p>In organizations we do roadmapping exercises that, when done
correctly, reflect possible transformations along a normal maturization
process.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Aside: spell checking says that maturization is not correct. But it
feels right. It is correct given a natural mastery of English.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, you don’t create a plan without the vision, but you
also can’t have the vision without the plan, given how things actually
normally develop.</p>
<p>In daily life, we miss the vision.</p>
<p>For example, when we cook dinner, we rarely think:</p>
<p>“Hey, I cook the same things again and again, so why not recognize
that I could have a recipe book to capture these meals to sell.”</p>
<p>It was common at one time for families to have recipes to share with
one another.</p>
<p>Family recipe books were not unusual.</p>
<p>But to take it further. If you cook every night, and you have the
ingredients at hand, and you enjoy what you are doing, why not realize
that your recipe book could be a menu.</p>
<p>You have your customers with you nightly.</p>
<p>You have the opportunity for immediate feedback.</p>
<p>You can take almost all steps that are possible, within your home
kitchen, to create a business. And it’s right in front of your eyes.</p>
<p>This is how maturity modeling can work for you in your everyday
life.</p>
<p>I had a dream to create a vegan restaurant according to this
approach.</p>
<p>Although now, I would probably do a near-vegan, vegetarian
restaurant.</p>
<p>In my life I have a kitchen that is very far from normal, so it isn’t
really possible to create culinary masterpieces.</p>
<p>However, why not take this idea for yourself.</p>
<p>Because even if the dream of creating a restaurant beloved by others
doesn’t come true,</p>
<p>you will have something to hand your children, and perhaps
grandchildren,</p>
<p>that will enable them to feed themselves and remember their family
heritage at the same time.</p>
<p>This idea does not only apply to cooking food.</p>
<blockquote>

picked out obvious errors. Good enough like in conversation.]</p>

<h2
id="the-best-mentors"><a name="the-best-mentors-track-your-life-categories">The
Best Mentors,</a></h2>
<p>have a feature in common that somehow goes unrecognized.</p>
<p>They track your life-categories.</p>
<p>As you speak to them,</p>
<p>they’ll listen,</p>
<p>but they may not always be concerned about the specifics of what you
are saying.</p>
<p>They’ll ask you questions that cut across your life.</p>
<p>And as conversations unfold,</p>
<p>they will easily come to find,</p>
<p>where you are out of balance.</p>
<p>This is where they will give you advice, that you will find useful
for self-application.</p>
<p>So you come to value their opinion because they are able to help you
see what you’re missing.</p>
<p>This is a feature common to all mentors.</p>
<p>It can be an elder, a friend, a priest, a doctor, a psychologist… or
anyone else who serves as a mentor in your life.</p>
<p>It is possible, however, to do this for yourself.</p>
<p>You can self-mentor, to a degree.</p>
<p>If you do not happen to have a mentor around. Not everyone does.</p>
<p>If you don’t, try to keep a list of the most important areas of your
life, that should not go untended.</p>
<p>If you are able to track these areas effectively, and make sure you
take care of each one carefully, you are likely to do well.</p>
<p>And then for a stretch of time, you might be able to forget to keep
track.</p>
<p>But if you come to a moment when you are out of balance again,</p>
<p>it is easy to go back to the list, and start all over again.</p>
<p>My life is out of balance again, and so this is what I’m doing for
myself now.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Note: I intend to upload the forms I used for doing this, on my
page, <a href="rational-times.html">rational-times.html</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This way you can see how I did it, how much is really possible to
keep track of, and have a starting point to do the same for
yourself.</p>
<p>Some may say that this is an obvious point.</p>
<p>But if you look around, nobody is doing it.</p>
<p>Particularly those who say it is obvious.</p>
<p>I know, because it is not easy to do, even if you spend quite a bit
of time collecting data.</p>
<p>It is time consuming.</p>
<p>This is why I want to help and provide what I created for your
benefit.</p>

face, and No-sin.</a></h2>
<p>I hear people talk of “saving face”.</p>
<p>“Saving face” is hardly something I personally aspire to.</p>
<p>I am an animal.</p>
<p>I let things go quickly.</p>
<p>Pangs of embarrassment are brief.</p>
<p>Guilt lasts as long as it should, and no longer.</p>
<p>I try to correct things quickly, when I’m aware of mistakes.</p>
<p>But I expect mistakes, so I do not think much of blame.</p>
<p>I’m a learning creature.</p>
<p>I do not look for revenge, because I want others to get past things
as well.</p>
<p>Others are learning creatures.</p>
<p>I reject the concept of “sin”.</p>
<p>People do not need to carry guilt forever.</p>
<p>People are animals that will do animal-like things.</p>
<p>According to nature.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The ones who are truly horrible have no honest recourse, in my mind,
to equalizing people,</p>
<p>by stating that “everyone is a sinner”.</p>
<p>That only means: “The good are as bad as I am, and are as bad as I
will continue to be.”</p>
<p>Why would anyone adopt that, as it so obviously favors the
wicked?</p>
<p>The equalizer is that we were all ignorant babies. That’s all we need
to say about that.</p>
<p>I say equalizer because even babies are unequal with respect to
ignorance.</p>

<p><em>“When I saw you working, I felt like I was missing something—I
felt like I must be doing something wrong.”</em></p>
<p>This is a close paraphrase of something a colleague once said to
me.</p>
<p>I repeat it because I thought it was kind and honest. I do not intend
to criticize this reaction in any way.</p>
<p>Nowadays, however, I think it’s closer to:</p>
<p><em>“I don’t really understand what he’s doing, but I will assume it
is foolish.”</em></p>
<p>or</p>
<p><em>“What he’s doing looks old-school. It’s ridiculous”</em></p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Only much later, after discovering the trajectory, there’s an “aha”
moment, that’s more like a rationalization:</p>
<p><em>“Oh I always knew you were doing that…”</em></p>
<p>Sure you did.</p>
<p>You only get to the end point with the steps it requires to get to
that endpoint.</p>
<p>You didn’t know any of the steps or the endpoint.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Steps in between may not be what you think they are.</p>
<p>And with myself, they seldom are.</p>
<p>People will judge you on your unfinished deeds as if they were
finished ones.</p>
<p>Take this ThoughtStream as an example.</p>
<p>The great thing about the ThoughtStream is that all deeds are
unfinished.</p>

Thoughts.</a></h2>
<p>Let’s honor veterans with the truths due to them.</p>
<p>I’ve said elsewhere, that</p>
<p>“Remember Forever”,</p>
<p>is not genuine.</p>
<p>People will forget just one day later.</p>
<p>And remember the phrase, when the ritual repeats, a year later.</p>
<p>This sounds negative to say.</p>
<p>But think it through, and you will see…</p>
<p>that people who sacrifice themselves in war,</p>
<p>are sacrificed completely.</p>
<p>Our memories are short.</p>
<p>When America is no more,</p>
<p>and we are blended with other nations,</p>
<p>memorials will lose significance.</p>
<p>So let’s think hard about it now,</p>
<p>and not plan to remember for eternity.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Is this not a more real,</p>
<p>and important message,</p>
<p>than any lie about remembering someone’s sacrifice forever?</p>
<p>Death for no reason,</p>
<p>is a part of war.</p>
<p>We need to value veterans enough,</p>
<p>to not lie to people who are thinking of joining the military,</p>
<p>and to encourage their children,</p>
<p>to think hard about the risks,</p>
<p>and to find other opportunities,</p>
<p>like rich people almost always do.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>I am grateful for my freedom to think and write what I wish on this
website,</p>
<p>and speak my mind in public.</p>
<p>And I understand the cost.</p>
<p>This is why I decided early that I would never serve in the
military.</p>
<p>And why I am unwilling to join in on the rituals.</p>
<p>I value the holiday,</p>
<p>and my freedom to think,</p>
<p>how I want to about it.</p>
<p>Thank you Veterans for this freedom.</p>

is freedom in the ThoughtStream.</a></h2>
<p>There is freedom in the ThoughtStream.</p>
<p>There are few consequences to your thoughts,</p>
<p>in the form of reactions from other people.</p>
<p>According to your nation’s laws.</p>
<p>(I hope. I enjoy this protection immensely.)</p>
<p>You are protected in this.</p>
<p>Likewise, in the U.S., you have First Amendment rights,</p>
<p>or Freedom of Speech.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(Aside: Nevermind that the right was designated <em>because</em> it
has not been secured for you. For if it were secured, there would be no
speaking of rights, as I’ve covered elsewhere. This is why we often
protest “It is my right!”—the protest concerns not having what was
supposedly ensured.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let us assume we are protected in this supposed Freedom,</p>
<p>such that we are free,</p>
<p>from having to consider if we have it or not.</p>
<p>So there will be no consequences for your thoughts outside your
head,</p>
<p>and not just inside your head,</p>
<p>because the responsibility for reactions,</p>
<p>lies in other people.</p>
<p>And corporations,</p>
<p>cannot discriminate against you,</p>
<p>because of your opinions,</p>
<p>outside of work.</p>
<p>And if they do,</p>
<p>you have recourse,</p>
<p>because they have not learned, of all the opinions of the rest of
their staff,</p>
<p>or openly made public their thoughts,</p>
<p>or used their freedoms,</p>
<p>in the way that you have.</p>
<p>Thus they can learn to be like you.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>I do not concern myself about the compulsivity of other people.</p>
<p>Or corporations.</p>
<p>Even in threats of violence.</p>
<p>Because they are the worst of all who make such threats.</p>
<p>Organized threats are more disgusting than individual ones.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Also you do not need to commit to what you think,</p>
<p>when you know shortly after you might think the opposite.</p>
<p>And so,</p>
<p>people need to learn,</p>
<p>that you might say something,</p>
<p>but that does not mean that it is final in any way.</p>
<p>You were just thinking aloud.</p>
<p>Like when you think aloud in your head.</p>
<p>And all is tentative,</p>
<p>because in Mattanaw’s Philosophy,</p>
<p>and in Philosophy in general,</p>
<p>skepticism requires,</p>
<p>that you form conclusions that might contrast significantly,</p>
<p>with what you thought before,</p>
<p>because that is what learning often is.</p>
<p><em>And we are all for learning, right?</em></p>
<p>…</p>
<p>You can sleepdream whatever you want.</p>
<p>You can daydream whatever you want.</p>
<p>You can speakdream whatever you want.</p>
<p>Blame your speakdreams on your sleepdreams.</p>
<p>Or sleepdreams on your speakdreams.</p>
<p>Because you don’t know the source of your thoughts in either
case.</p>
<p>But you do know they are connected to each other.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>There are times for greater care,</p>
<p>but most times are not those times.</p>
<p>Unless censors, discriminators, and the punitive have their way.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Fortunately, Philosophy is my religion.</p>
<p>And so I am protected.</p>
<p>Are you protected?</p>

<p>See that logic is math-logic.</p>
<p>Then your trust will increase.</p>
<p>Your Philosophy will improve.</p>
<p>You’ll learn that you don’t choose a philosophy.</p>
<p>As if they are mutually exclusive, and you can’t have them all
intermixed.</p>
<p>Logic permeates everything you do.</p>
<p>See that all your reasoning depends on the logic,</p>
<p>and see all of the errors you’ve been making,</p>
<p>and all the life-long errors of your parents and ancestors,</p>
<p>and all the errors you will continue to make.</p>
<p>Practice will show you,</p>
<p>even if you don’t care for formal logic,</p>
<p>but only the informal logic of language,</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>truth preserving chains are hard to come by,</p>
<p>and are hard to tease from,</p>
<p>pointed intuitions born of complex experience.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Describe the newborn in a list of just 100 sentences
interconnected.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Images are worth a thousand words.”</p>
<p>If so than how many words worth are in a video of a million
frames?</p>
<p>If we just go by videos composed of frames.</p>
<p>And not pattern chains.</p>
<p>More still. How many words are in the life of the situation?</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Sometimes you need quite a lot in your arguments,</p>
<p>So there are limitations even in logic,</p>
<p>Since logic does not use pictures,</p>
<p>or pithy pointers of dense life-capsules.</p>
<p>Logic is ultimately abandoned for this same reason,</p>
<p>that too much is required for proof,</p>
<p>of complex things we actually care about, when the scope is as wide
as living.</p>
<p>And what we want to show,</p>
<p>requires another media,</p>
<p>like film,</p>
<p>or other artful creation.</p>
<p>Yet it is required nevertheless,</p>
<p>to intuit errors,</p>
<p>and to have the right experience to get a feel for when more complex
arguments</p>
<p>really are right.</p>
<p>And to realize,</p>
<p>that even if logic must be abandoned to cover more,</p>
<p>logic is still in the foundation,</p>
<p>and we just simply don’t have enough time to use it,</p>
<p>in all cases.</p>

insights and fallacies.</a></h2>
<p>To determine if a fallacy is present in an insight, briefly recorded,
one has to be able to correctly translate the insight into the requisite
logic, that presents the best argument for that insight.</p>
<p>This is the principle of charity in Philosophy.</p>
<p>Intuition precedes the rigorous proofs of the intuitions.</p>
<p>Naysayers will say: “You committed your own errors. Here… let me show
you…”</p>
<p>But then what they show you is not true to the original insight,</p>
<p>for which the logical proofs are forthcoming.</p>
<p>So they show you irrelevances,</p>
<p>and fallacies within mistranslations,</p>
<p>that they attribute to the author, instead of themselves.</p>
<p>Or they pretend there are fallacies to exhibit an understanding of
logic, that happens to be false.</p>
<p>Mistranslations are generated to satisfy desires for fallacies to
exist.</p>
<p>This is why it is important to wait for works of expression,</p>
<p>to come to completion.</p>

<p>It depends on the student,</p>
<p>and the teacher.</p>
<p>Logic is a first start.</p>
<p>It is a branch of Philosophy!</p>
<p>Your trust in math. It should extend to logic too.</p>
<p>The logic is foundational to math. And to argumentation.</p>
<p>Any argument you construct with words will be sound and valid, only
if the logic is correct.</p>
<p>This means, in the current organization of topics in College
curricula, that you need to get your Philosophy right to get your
argumentation right.</p>
<p>Logic could be separated from Philosophy, but they are historically
intertwined for good reason.</p>
<p>Back to topic: Logic and Math are nearly one and the same.</p>
<p>Logic is more foundational to everyday purposes however.</p>
<p>You can place the same trust and faith you have for math in
Philosophy, since in Philosophy, logic is paramount.</p>
<p>Although</p>
<p>this must be combined with healthy skepticism.</p>
<p>Logic leads one to skepticism</p>
<p>since truth is so hard to come by,</p>
<p>and people are credulous by nature.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(Aside: Recall the faith you put in human equality, through trust of
math. That math wasn’t even there. Put faith in math-logic, if the
math-logic is actually there, and it is sound. Do the same with other
acts of faith. Confirm that what you have faith in is present
first.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>…</p>
<p>Devotion to longer sentences is another path to truth.</p>
<p>Short sentences are incomplete pointers.</p>
<p>Tools of importance, but tools lacking nevertheless.</p>

id="is-it-really-an-analogy"><a name="gaps-in-language-and-missing-or-impossible-analogies">Is
it Really an Analogy?</a></h2>
<p>A friend recently posted an interesting analogy puzzle on Facebook,
for which the answer was uncertain, because of a gap in the English
language.</p>
<p>This is not unusual. It is very common for us to search for a word
that is an antonym of another more familiar word, because we want to
apply the same concept, in a converse situation. Whenever there seems to
be a word missing for an occasion, an analogy could be formed, such that
there would not be a word providing the answer in the language.</p>
<p>Consider this example:</p>
<p>Idyllic:Utopia::Hellish:<fill-in></p>
<p>What is the answer?</p>
<p>In my days tutoring, I had a High School student ask me:</p>
<p>What is the opposite of a Utopia?</p>
<p>I asked this same question myself, after reading some of More’s
Utopia, and reflecting on George Orwell’s 1984, and came to the answer
after some pause, as is quite characteristic for me, of “Dystopia.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(Aside: I have an excellent memory but have to fight against similar
words to which I’m more primed to respond with, or otherwise have better
availability. Everyone experiences tip of the tongue, but this appears
to be a quirk that I’m not sure I’ve observed in anyone I met
previously. I’m certain others experience the same but have not
encountered anyone who experienced it in quite the same way. Because
after some time elapses, the word and quite a bit else becomes
completely and rapidly accessible. A large chunk of memory simply isn’t
available when first prompted at times. I mention this because it will
become relevant in other posts.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Idyllic:Utopia::Hellish:Dystopia</p>
<p>In this case there is an answer. But what if the word “Dystopia” did
not exist?</p>
<p>In that case, it is my view, that there probably is not an answer to
the analogy, unless one can coin a word that truly fulfills the analogy
correctly. By this I mean that it is a true analogy, without ambiguity,
such that there is at least one denotation that clearly parallels the
denotation of the other (meaning a complete dictionary would have a
numbered entry for each word), and not a partial match among
denotations, or a partial match among connotations. A word could also be
borrowed from another language, which is essentially the same as a
coinage, so I don’t see the two as essentially different, since the goal
is simply to fill a gap in native language another word that fulfills
some criterion of comparison.</p>
<p>However, there are unusual cases where the logic of the words
themselves allows for no parallel at all. Such that a word borrowed from
another language, or a coinage, does not establish an analogy, because
the conditions of successful analogy cannot be established in the way
hoped for.</p>
<p>This relates to the Analogy that my friend posted. I will not repeat
that analogy here for the moment, without his permission, but only
mention that it is interesting and involved a probable structural
asymmetry, meaning no analogy could be formed, at least in the way
indicated, in what could be expressed about our feelings of past events,
versus what we imagine about the future.</p>

Patterns that Repeat, are Expected to Repeat.</a></h2>
<p>History does not actually repeat.</p>
<p>When the earth becomes a cold ball of ice floating through space,</p>
<p>we cannot expect that it will be generated afresh,</p>
<p>to proceed exactly as before.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The logic that intends to use this phrase,</p>
<p>involving the idea that we can somehow stop history’s patterns by
learning about history,</p>
<p>is committing the Monte-Carlo fallacy.</p>
<p>That which has been repeated many times, is expected to not be
repeated next time?</p>
<p>Because someone read an inaccurate textbook?</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>If not the Monte Carlo fallacy,</p>
<p>then the error is in a misjudgment of the powers of individuals.</p>
<p>For how could an individual, be expected to counter historical
patterns that have always been repeated,</p>
<p>to not repeat,</p>
<p>such that future generations would not use the same phrasing
themselves?</p>
<p>Some things change. But the phrase is too short to encompass
that.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Not one situtation, at a complex level involving people, understood
completely, happened twice.</p>
<p>Unless the entire universe is being repeated, which might be the
case.</p>
<p>Patterns are repeating, however.</p>
<p>Math before is useful after.</p>
<p>We’re told that some patterns have been repeating all through
history.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(Which ones exactly? Putting that aside for now.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then we’re told, that we need to understand history, because history
repeats.</p>
<p>But it’s been happening for all of history.</p>
<p>Inductively it will happen again.</p>
<p>An individual’s learning of history has not been inductively proven
to prevent natural patterns from repeating.</p>
<p>“History Repeats Itself” may just include, people saying “History
Repeats Iself” to no avail?</p>
<p>There are no specific goals in this phrase.</p>
<p>It is not as meaningful as people hope.</p>
<p>In fact its meaning is against hope.</p>
<p>Irrational hopes at least.</p>
<p>Because we are included in history’s patterns.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Polio is a pattern that repeated,</p>
<p>for different people,</p>
<p>who had different histories.</p>
<p>It was combated, and does not repeat quite the same way,</p>
<p>in the same numbers.</p>
<p>However, the source of the change,</p>
<p>was not an understanding of history.</p>
<p>but biology.</p>

Rasa Pseudo-math. Escaping the Founders’ Many Errors.</a></h2>
<p>The founders made many mistakes.</p>
<p>But they cannot be faulted for using the psychological perspectives
of their age.</p>
<p>They made advancements through their interim advancements.</p>
<p>The errors and the advancements are part of the same tooling, for the
desired outcomes.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>This is the logic of an ancient psychological viewpoint:</p>
<ul>
<li>We are all born human &gt;</li>
<li>We start knowing almost nothing &gt;</li>
<li>We are like blank slates &gt;</li>
<li>Blank slates resemble each other like factory products &gt;</li>
<li>Tablets have the same potential for inscription &gt;</li>
<li>If we are all blank slates, we have this in common &gt;</li>
<li>Therefore, we are born equal. &gt;</li>
<li>Therefore, we are equal. &gt;</li>
<li>Therefore this, therefore that.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then <em>we take it to be</em> self-evident, forgetting there is no
math here.</p>
<p>Euclid would not approve. He made few errors and is far more
ancient.</p>
<p>There are axioms, and then there are, ahem… <em>assumptions</em>.</p>
<p>Ignorance makes its way into the scrolls easily.</p>
<p>Think not? Show me the controls.</p>
<p><em>Or write your thoughts on scrolls, and see how quickly you add
falsities!</em></p>
<p>The logician knows the difficulty of uttering chains of truths.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Why don’t we just say: “We were all babies.” and be done with it?</p>
<p>We all knew very close to <em>nothing</em>.</p>
<p>We were nearly equal in our <em>ignorance</em>, although we were
never equal on almost any other measure. Probably not regarding
ignorance either, but close enough…</p>
<p>We are the result of cellular replications. Sperm and egg.</p>
<p>Here we have truth, and we can still use our knowledge of genetics
and diversity, without feeling the urge to cover that up.</p>
<p>This is the great escape.</p>
<p>From the error of the founding father (I’m thinking of one gentleman
in particluar).</p>
<p>And a historical document, hastily written?</p>
<p>Sacred inky fibers?</p>

<p>“Free speech” is limited of course.</p>
<p>What we actually have is:</p>
<p><em>Limited speech.</em></p>
<p>…</p>
<p>A lesson in accuracy.</p>
<p>Still, this sentence is too short.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Let’s briefly consider our</p>
<p>Limited Speech.</p>
<p>One way we are limited is by censors who are allowed to speak,
because they have the same “freedoms” themselves.</p>
<p>Oftentimes, the censors, in anger, promote violence, ostracism, and
other acts of cruelty.</p>
<p>“I don’t like what she says, therefore, I can do whatever I want to
her.”</p>
<p>They want to silence others.</p>
<p>Not by open debate or argumentation with freely flowing words.</p>
<p>They prefer <em>censorship words.</em></p>
<p>They’ll promote censorship <em>killing</em>, if they are allowed to
run wild.</p>
<p>If not killing through murder, they’ll choose <em>killing by
character assassination.</em></p>
<p>And they might get the final word, the way things are currently
organized.</p>
<p>This goes overlooked somehow.</p>
<p>If we insist on true free speech, then we are limiting
censorship-related speech somehow.</p>
<p>It is not clear how we should do that.</p>
<p>Surely, the censors calling for violence or retribution are the ones
who err.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“I don’t like what he says, therefore, I can do whatever I want to
him.”</p>
<p>This is quite different than:</p>
<p>“I don’t like what he says, and these are the reasons why, for your
consideration…”</p>

<p>And sometimes, writing is just a substitute for oral
communication.</p>
<p>A principle I follow, often misunderstood, almost always
underappreciated, is that it is often more efficient to share an idea
before perfectly communicating it.</p>
<p>Hr’s som typos I can fx later, if I ever care to.</p>
<p>I hope you get to the idea, in the same way that you can, listening
to someone speak aloud.</p>
<p>We are poor at detecting grammatical errors in normal speech
anyhow.</p>
<p>The transition from ears to eyes has interesting consequences.</p>
<p>Just write and get that feedback loop. For the idea and for the
writing. Because you don’t need to edit what you will abandon
anyways.</p>
<p>The writing can have mistakes. Just like with speaking.</p>
<p>You do not edit your speech.</p>
<p>Critics of your writing don’t edit their speech either. They are
abandoning sentences midway constantly.</p>
<p>If someone continually fails to understand you, for not speaking
aloud in perfectly grammatical sentences, you would probably wish to
stop speaking to them.</p>
<p>They may even be pretending to care about what you say, out of their
special interest in correcting people.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The best communication, is when minds “click.”</p>
<p>Mindfully linked, lost in thought. Not distracted by a desire to
correct.</p>
<p>People who are knit-picking get what they want in the <em>final</em>
edit. That happens later.</p>
<p>The easiest edits.</p>
<p>Again, no one corrects grammar in oral communication.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>This principle is not to be applied in all situations. There is a
range.</p>
<p>There are times to take editing quite seriously in advance of
releasing. But this is not a post about that.</p>
<p>This is a post about why that other approach is not a universally
justifiable methodology.</p>

<h2
id="impartiality-is-prior-to-equality."><a name="impartiality-is-prior-to-equality">Impartiality
is Prior to Equality.</a></h2>
<p>Equality is not impartiality.</p>
<p>Impartiality says, “we haven’t taken any measurements to be able to
make this comparison”, and so is prior even to an assumption of
equality.</p>
<p>To claim equality, is to be partial to the conclusion that values
that have been taken, are actually equal to one another, in the area of
interest. Thus, it is as partial as inequality, which is arrived at, by
the very same process of taking measurements and making comparisons.</p>
<p>Inequality has the edge though, since values, at high precision,
would not be expected to line up. Even in the creation of high-precision
machinery, flaws and inconsistencies cannot be removed. Thus, we can
assume there is at least some level of inequality for almost all
comparisons of non-elemental things. I will give examples of things that
can be considered equal, and how, in an upcoming article. Equal things
are never complex objects considered in total, to be sure. The examples
I provide exhibit the stark contrast, between what might be equal, and
comparisons between people. Social justice is intended to be
<em>improved</em> with a return to looking at details that reveal
inequalities, and the true extent of similarities.</p>
<p>Scientists are supposed to be impartial. That <em>does not mean they
are supposed to assume equalities exist</em>, without taking
measurements. They are in the business of measuring, collecting data,
and then forming judgments. The assumption of equality is a completely
incorrect approach to mathematics.</p>
<p>Scientists are supposed to think “I will refrain from making a claim
as to the values until I’ve actually done the work.”</p>
<p>“Eyeballing” it is OK, from time to time, but it is subject to error.
It tends to favor identification of differences, and some degree of
similarity, but not strict equality.</p>

id="do-you-ignore-the-language-spectra"><a name="do-you-ignore-the-language-spectra">Do
you ignore the language spectra?</a></h2>
<p>Languages range from those in their infancy, to those in high
maturity.</p>
<p>High maturity in a language, is connected with available knowledge,
and the ease of generating new knowledge.</p>
<p>This is related to concept complexity, and total language
vocabulary.</p>
<p>A language can range from a couple thousand words, to millions, as
might be the case, in the Personlanguage.</p>
<p>In the beginnings of people geographically interspersed, in
isolation, multiple languages were created, with just a few words.</p>
<p>The range is from animal proto-language to what we have today, and
later, into the Personlanguage.</p>
<p>There is no equality amongst languages.</p>
<p>In a field of complex objects, there are differences to be seen, by
anyone with high-resolution understanding, atop any sameness that might
exist, that would also be seen, though such an understanding.</p>
<p>And so languages are greatly unequal despite similarities. The trick
is <em>to atually look</em> and not resort to equalization bias, in a
pretense of understanding.</p>
<p>By acting as though things are equal, one pretends that one has
actually made an observation of what is to be compared.</p>
<p>Do you know what seeing the spectra implies?</p>
<p>It implies seeing humanity along a maturity progression, with poorer
language stimulation initially, and better language maturity later
on.</p>
<p>The different languages we observe today, are at different stages of
language maturation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Clarification 1.</strong> I received one valuable comment
that value comparisons of languages depends on the criteria of the
person or people making the comparisons. To this, I offered the
following answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>We are in agreement as to equality being criteria based, and it’s
funny that you put it that way, because I have an article in preparation
that goes into depth along that same train of thought. People tend to
say that two things are equal with no criteria at all, and fail to make
any comparison at all. Whatever criteria are used, values must be
determined, a comparison has to be made, and sameness of value
identified. All else is a form of cultural bias. A cultural bias that
oddly enough, results in an inability to look closely. There is this “I
refuse to compare languages” according to valuations, stemming from a
pretense that “they are equally valued”, without any valuation having
taken place.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>…you are engaging in what I hope to engage in– finding those ways
that they might be compared in useful ways, leading to valuations. And
they should lead to valuations. From these valuations we can seek to
make instrumentality comparisons.</em></p>

<p>Thus many pieces of advice, and quotations, are more general than
they are supposed to be, due to human laziness.</p>
<p>“Thou shalt not lie.”</p>
<p>Please can you give more detail than this!?</p>
<p>Don’t be a lazy quote generator.</p>
<p>Thou shalt not lie, when exactly…?</p>
<p>This is an <em>OBVIOUS</em> problem, and the quote is worthless.</p>
<p>When your representation of the situation itself, reaches the
ultimate level of specificity, it mirrors the uniqueness contained,
revealing the truth in that situation, that it does not have in common
with any other.</p>
<p>So there is a stopping point, <em>to allow, at least
<strong>ONE</strong> analogy</em>. If you represent a situation fully,
there are no analogies.</p>
<p>When the detail you provide for a situation is great enough, you see
there has never been another equivalent situation. If you leave out
details, analogies emerge.</p>
<p>History does not repeat. It only repeats for those who employ low
resolution understanding. For others, it does not repeat, but there is a
pattern of importance worth seeing, that does not extend down all the
way into the phenomenon, or without such detail, that no other can be
found that does match the pattern.</p>
<p>Equivalent resolution is required for an analogy to be found.</p>
<p>The stupid can find analogies for anything and everything, by
simplifying it, such that there are few details.</p>
<p>This is what we do, when we claim two things are the same, for
belonging to the same category, at the highest level.</p>
<p>Here’s your “all people are equal.”</p>
<p>“They are humans, yes. Thank you for that. Now lets talk about
details.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>False equivalence of situations are created by low resolution analogy
generation. Sometimes this is useful. Other times, it is an avoidance of
detail, for the preservation of equivalence, to preserve some objective
or perspective.</p>
<p>False equivalence bias. Equality bias. Low resolution preference
bias.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Counterfactuals are easier to find the more shallow the situational
representation. Why? Here’s this detail that is just a little deeper
than your analogy, that is a relevant difference.</p>
<p>Conversely, the deeper the representation, in the advice, the less
able we are to find counterexamples, to matching situations. Part
because it requires more thinking, however. And part, because there are
simply less counterexamples.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Another way to think of this. Ask yourself:</p>
<p>Does my analogy have enough detail, to remain an analogy, for these
situations, without creating too much ease of generating
counterfactuals?</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Or:</p>
<p>What is the pattern match, and would a deeper more meticulous
pattern, reveal that really there are fewer instances of interest, such
that my advice is defeated?</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Avoid:</p>
<p>“I see this thing everywhere because I have not seen it in enough
detail.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>This is a posting about using longer sentences instead of shorter
ones. Paragraphs if necessary. Pages and books. Encyclopedias.</p>
<p>Or at least knowing, what the <em>pagination would be</em> for the
idea under consideration, and the “fudge-factor”.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The fewer the details, the simpler the reductio ad absurdum.</p>
<p>All situational analogies are subject to the reductio.</p>
<p>This requires a bit more explanation but the ThoughtStream is for
incomplete thoughts as well as complete ones.</p>

in the Diversity.</a></h2>
<p>A celebration of diversity is incompatible with a schematic
insistence on equality.</p>
<p>Higher education, and maturity, over a lifetime, reveal to us that
diversity is a proper assumption, atop any sameness that might exist, in
a field of complex objects. Detailed examinations of complex objects
reveal varieties needing to be accounted for.</p>
<p>Diversity is a time-honoured assumption that is factual. Equality is
not. As a tool for civil rights marketing, catalyzing all-important
changes, it was a huge success. But that success never made “equality”
in the general and vague sense any sort of fact.</p>
<p>The social justice we should be aiming for, is in the appreciation of
details and diversity, not in equality.</p>
<p>Because today, people use equality as a replacement for observation
and thought.</p>
<p>To look closely is to find relevant differences. This is what we know
of meticulousness. High-resolution understanding.</p>
<p>Equality is easily “found” by ignoring details.</p>
<p>A more socially just world, would require a more complex
understanding of justice, which would depend on an appreciation for
details, not an exclusion of details to preserve <em>assumptions</em>
about equality.</p>
<p><em>Wisdom is in the details.</em> <em>Diversity is in the
details.</em></p>
<p>Equality is no-place to be found, and was a temporary marketing
position on the way to a future of refined social justice, relating to
more sophisticated ideas about fairness, and the fitness of things. To
improve on what we have, we need to be willing to look at details again,
and give up on the concept of equality, that was only there to
facilitate change historically. It has been useful but in the present
day we need to transition to something more intelligent.</p>
<p>We need to look at people and see their similarities and their
differences.</p>
<p>A celebration of diversity is incompatible with a schematic
insistence on equality.</p>

<p>When you meet someone who gets irritated about repeating himself for
you to hear, or to understand, notice how impatient he seems.</p>
<p>If there is any disparity between you and him, favorable to you,
consider the following exercise, for dealing with such people.</p>
<p>Depart from your norm of speaking short sentences that are designed
for people like him to understand; and shift to a more rapid mode of
speech akin to your natural thoughts, with your more sophisticated
vocabulary, with fewer logical transitions, and a complete resistance to
interjections and distractions. Include that tight focus you have that
nevertheless allows for oblique meanderings and lateralizations, that
you then pull back into the original topic.</p>
<p>Then ask him detailed questions.</p>
<p>Then castigate him? Potentially. For his inability to follow,
inability to remember, inability to pay attention, inability to
visualize, inability to build on the conversation, <em>inability to
understand the full potential of relevance</em>. Inability to have a
conversation with you.</p>
<p>You know, all those things <em>everyone</em> is failing to do in
conversation all the time.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, I was not paying attention, because I was relating my
life, and these new ideas, to all you were saying until now… In other
words, I was respecting your mind.”</p>
<p>That much is probably not necessary, but if his politeness does not
return, it is a real option to consider.</p>
<p>The toolkit of the educator is large and it does include this.</p>

<p>To confirm that two things are equal, in some particular way, first
you determine the values.</p>
<p>You take the measurements!</p>
<p>Yes… you take the measurements…</p>
<p><em>Then, <strong>after</strong> you determine the values, and you
have <strong>numbers</strong>…</em> …</p>
<p>to a certain level of precision…</p>
<p>you <em>compare</em> the <em>values</em>, and <em>if</em> they are
the same, then you can say they are equal, <em>in that respect</em>, for
<em>that level of precision.</em></p>
<p>To say two things are equal, without having followed this process, is
to make an obvious error.</p>
<p>(People in Democracies often forget all of the steps.)</p>
<p>Sometimes we know the values will differ just using our senses. A man
is 7 feet tall; his wife is 5. Unless our precision of measure is to the
nearest ten feet (like we are comparing from space), we say they are
unequal with respect to height.</p>
<p>But when two people are nearly the same height, we have to look more
closely. High precision usually reveals inequality for complex
things.</p>
<p>This is why we humans opt for <em>no precision at all</em>, when
comparing humans. If we do compare.</p>
<p>A ridiculous error, precision aside, is to have no objects to
compare…</p>
<p><em>We do that! In our rational
<strong>ratiocinations?</strong>…</em></p>
<p>Ask your math teacher about equality in class, and she will know the
answer.</p>
<p>Ask her in politics, and she will forget she’s a math teacher.</p>

<p>Which team do you belong to for the sport you have not played or
seen?</p>
<p>Before you get confused, understand that you do not really know many
political topics well. They are numerous. For every topic, there are
different subject matter experts to call upon, with differing
opinions.</p>
<p>I take my politics issue by issue, as I take my knowledge topic by
topic. I know where my ignorance lies. I know my level of research. I
know when to stay uninvolved, and mind my own business.</p>
<p>I recently described my political affiliation to an inquirer like
this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I consider everything topic by topic, issue by issue, policy by
policy, according to what makes sense to solve problems, and understand
situations. Thus I have no affiliation and am in agreement with one or
the other [liberal or conservative], or both, or any other person or
group, or none at all, on any issue. I prefer to ignore the existence of
parties while I think about which solutions are sensible.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>After determining what is sensible, I’m comfortable with any blend
and combination of agreement or disagreement with any subsets of the
constellation of human thoughts, however they happen to be arranged in
time and space, within individuals and amongst humanity.</p>

“One Small Step For Man”.</a></h2>
<p>A fake moon landing was necessary to control perceptions of supremacy
during the cold war. The United States, well behind the Soviet Union,
who had public success with Sputnik and other programs, had no time to
catch up in aerospace. Instead, to buy time, and to fain dominance, they
relied on Hollywood and their superior entertainment capabilities to
stage the moon landing. It was a great success, and even now layman are
unable to prove definitively, from the footage itself, that the footage
is fake.</p>
<p>Today, moon landings are not performed, because of the difficulty and
low value of such missions. What is of value is doing all that is
possible to achieve world dominance. This is the reason space programs
have not been able to catch up with the heights that the entertainment
industry has attained, and have not been fully extricated from military
operations.</p>
<p>The creation of a false moon landing remains one of the most
successful military operations in the history of the United States.</p>

Rigged Designs.</a></h2>
<p>Yesterday I had a run-in with a Coinstar machine. After the
experience, I feel convinced the machine is designed to systematically
extract more than the agreed upon percentage advertised at the beginning
of the transaction.</p>
<p>Why do I think so? I’ll elaborate in a full article later, but for
now, I will simply point out that the UX design of the terminal and the
process flow logically implies it.</p>
<p>The physical design of the machine itself, and the timing of the
interactions with the user seem to favor Coinstar for receiving more (in
my experience far more) than they indicate at the outset.</p>
<p>Then an old question occurred to me: are casino software games and
slot machines rigged? How would one know? <em>What effort is required
for a consumer to discover it, versus the effort in the design to
conceal it?</em> Certainly, there are ways to know but mathematically,
the design could make any efforts at discovering it too difficult or
costly.</p>
<p>I think Coinstar machines are more obvious than casino machines, but
the same questions are raised.</p>
<p>See my related questions on Quora, if you happen to have some real
knowledge and experience with this topic.</p>

the goals.</a></h2>
<p>If you have many goals you are working on in parallel, slowly but
surely, it is much more difficult to be disappointed with a poor outcome
for any single goal.</p>
<p>Diversify. Math and economics exist in the world of goals too. Think
of goals as investments.</p>
<p>Just remember there are people with no goals, or only one that they
put all their effort into. They fail and then have nothing else in
progress. Don’t be that person if you are able to dream more than one
dream.</p>
<p>Some need the focus of just having one or two goals, due to position
in life, or because the goal is foundational (nadir of Maslow’s
hierarchy). If you need to quit smoking, you may need to just focus on
that.</p>
<p>The advice of having many parallel goals may be for those who already
have a foundation, or those who are especially energetic, creative, or
generative.</p>

<h2 id="see-the-relationship"><a name="see-the-relationship">See the
relationship!</a></h2>
<p>If you are conflicted about the status of a relationship you have
with another person, it is helpful to forget about traditional
categories (friend, husband, girlfriend, father, etc..). Disconnect the
emotions from the words. These categories can cloud our vision from time
to time, setting us up for disappointment, via excess idealism and
naiveté. Build a detailed picture of the relationship as characteristics
of objects and their specific connections to one another. See the
relationship for what it is. Think of all the parts of the relationship,
so you’re not hyperfocused on just one or two parts.</p>
<p>Suddenly common questions about whether someone is a “friend” or an
“acquaintance” or a “frenemy” vanish. There are just people and
relationships, and there are usually mixed characteristics. Let your
friend dislike you from time to time. See the reality and lose the
cultural idealism, and sometimes you’ll find that your hopes,
expectations, and emotions are tied to words, and not to realities.</p>
