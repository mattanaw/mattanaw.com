<p>I want to provide acknowledgement to some key individuals who have
provided me support for my intellect in critical ways in formative
periods, where I was not myself acknowledged for my own intelligence,
despite having already been identified as gifted in youth. These people
have been very important for my overall development into a person who
has realized nearly completely his own potential. Initially, as a
student, I performed very well, but later I became disillusioned with
school, and adults, for being largely ignored despite offering
kindnesses and obvious intelligence my entire upbringing. In High School
I eventually decided to “drop out”, another term I don’t like, and get
my equivalency diploma (G.E.D). My future appeared somewhat dreary and
uncertain at that time, although I was always extremely self-confident
and mostly aware of the nature of my abilities. Independent reading and
instruction at a local community college <a
href="http://www.mattanaw.com/open-health-mattanaw.html#earlier-id-cards-and-social-security-card">Montgomery
College</a> provided a few extremely great instructors who provided
exactly the attention I was needing at the right time, and provided
acknowledgement of my own distinctive giftedness. At that time, I was
also fortunate enough to stumble upon courses on Psychology and
Philosophy exposing me to moral philosophy, that included a lineage of
thinkers who I already thought much like I did. This brought to my
attention minds of people who were really like me finally, who were
published because of a thinking style not unlike my own. I had no
experience like this in my life until this time and it was like
discovering profoundly gifted people that were hard for others to
understand thought like I did.</p>
<p>The first I’d like to acknowledge is Bertrand Russell, the deceased
eminent philosopher. Upon reading his works, I had the emotional
discovery of someone who seemed to be a worthy mentor. I’m not sure all
I learned from him, but his influence in my life has been extensive. His
works created a pathway for a lifetime love and enjoyment of Philosophy
and many other topics, since he was a generalist, and provided me
thousands of opportunities for reflecting on a range of topics that I
developed from that time to the present day.</p>
<p>Another mentor and teacher who had a great influence is the
Philosopher Peter Singer. Peter Singer was an early exposure to
professional Moral Philosophy, and convinced me of the importance of
expanding our moral behavior to be inclusive of animals. I became a
vegetarian in 2000, and vegan in 2001, almost solely due to reflections
on his works Practical Ethics, and Animal Liberation. As a result, my
buying and eating behavior, and social behavior, have been affected
positively for decades, and by reading his texts, I am especially
contented and satisfied with my history of moral behavior, for my
greatly diminished responsibility for the harms and sufferings of
animals and other people. While reading one of his texts, I reached out
to him at Princeton with a kind note, as an external student, simply
reading his books without being enrolled in his courses. He was kind
enough to respond and the simple and candid message from him is still
appreciated and has provided some unknown level of encouragement.
Reading his works in the same period of my readings of Bertrand Russell,
he has also encouraged my love of book reading, and my desire to write a
book of my own, including this one. I’ve read a number of his other
texts and they have each seemed to be truthful and consistent, and worth
utilizing for permanent self-alteration.</p>
<p>Mr. Scott Jacobsen, to my surprise, had already recently interviewed
Mr. Singer regarding other interests, and I discovered long after
Mr. Jacobsen had already written me with his request for interview,
after I wrote the above acknowledgement to Singer, for another book I’m
completing, more squarely covering moral philosophy. Peter Singer’s
interview with Mr. Jacobsen can be read in <em><a
href="https://in-sightpublishing.com/2023/06/05/interview-with-dr-peter-singer/">Insight
Journal</a></em>. It was shocking to learn the same person interviewing
me recently interviewed one of my favorite authors.</p>
<p>My community college instructor as I said was of special significance
to me. This is Shuping Wan, a history professor I had from Montgomery
College, a Chinese Immigrant, who gave me much needed attention and
validation that was entirely unreceived in my years in High School. His
teachings and his encouragements caused me to have durable success in
academics after a long period of doing much more poorly before being in
his class. He was the first instructor I had who would give highly
personalized attention, and I was able to develop a relationship with
him while I continued my studies at the college, which were always
supportive. Recalling his courses I recognize his influence regarding my
propensity to be highly unnationalistic, and my desire to avoid
advertising generally to avoid false information. Interestingly for part
of my career I found myself in digital marketing, but I shunned
television for over a decade to avoid seeing anything too irritating.
Advertising is too similar to wartime propaganda in my estimation.</p>
<p>These three people have especially influenced me for longer periods,
either through many interactions or from many reading experiences, that
were solitary. It is interesting to think of how much time I spent, in
particular with Mr. Russell and Mr. Singer simply through paper.
Hundreds of hours were spent reflecting on their thoughts and my
reactions to them. Bertrand Russell was my first intellectual friend, I
thought, at one point. I was recurringly saddened reflecting that he was
no longer alive, and that my independent conversations were including a
writer of now dead recordings. I think others must have had similar
experiences, with authors who were greatly valued but were not available
for conversation in real life.</p>
<h3
id="thanks-to-other-authors"><a name="thanks-to-other-authors">Thanks to
Other Authors</a></h3>
<p>I have also been influenced regarding the topic of propaganda and
media control by by Prof. Noam Chomsky, and like Prof. Singer had a very
short email transaction, which was humorously more cranky since my email
was a bit rude, which is an irregularity for me (I was young), but his
response did also provide some encouragement concerning willingness of
various authors to be responsive to inquiries from readers who were
enjoying their works.</p>
<p>I would also like to give kind acknowledgement to Mr. Daniel Dennett,
author of <em>Breaking the Spell</em>, for highly intelligent
encouragement regarding my non-commitment to any particular religion,
along with Richard Dawkins, author of <em>The God Delusion</em>, who
wrote a book also supporting my naturalistic and secular outlook. Today
I ignore any mention of any diety as a totally unwanted advertising or
sales solicitation and encroachment, and focus on the development of my
own ethic that is effectively a religion replacement of better
quality.</p>
<p>Mr. Dawkins has communicated his experience of death threats from his
views, and this was supportive since I would experience the same
personally once I gained a certain level of personal eminence. It also
relates well to the subject matter of this interview around being
cautious of others who might be intelligent but risky individuals, and
many of the threats I received like him were via writings received from
others.</p>
<p>I am grateful for Prof. Tao, who is working in an abstruse and
esoteric field in which few works extend over the last 3 centuries, and
without it would no have as much support on my efforts, like Professor
Tao, to make changes to the foundations of Mathematics and diversely
related fields.</p>
<p>Special thanks to Professor Donald Knuth, of Stanford University, for
his publication of the book series <em>The Art of Computer
Programming</em>, that comprises a life-work of the sort discussed in
this book. This book has aided me in the planning of my project of
creating a new computing system better founded on a more natural form of
mathematics and logic.</p>
<p>Thanks to Charles Murray and Richard Herrnstein, writers of the very
controversial work <em>The Bell Curve</em>. It is known and understood
that the extent of negative publicity and reactiveness to this work must
have been greatly threatening, and this issue of reader backlash is
related to the author’s desire to support the diminution of problems
faced by the desire to create honest scientific publications that help
everyone. I obtained my first copy of the Bell Curve in my teens and
remember having it in my possession at 17 years old and perhaps earlier.
I fit into a strange demographic, both doing poorly in school, at the
time, but also being immeasurably intelligent. Reading the demographics
there were indicators that I would do extremely well, or extremely
poorly, because dropping out of school I knew I would fall in the lower
quartile group of performance in High School, and your publication
stated that I would have a higher probability of having less life
success. Since this is probabilisitic,I did not take it negatively, but
many in the public failed to recognize what was utilized was demographic
and statistical. There was no good cause for your being targeted, and
your data supported my planning, even at that time, when it indicated I
could be at risk.</p>
<p>In the present writing and my present efforts is an application of
immeasurable intelligence to works, and to experience relating to the
high intelligence community and the public. Even at 17 I thought there
were some defects in the Bell Curve relating to global data, and this of
course relates to ethics affecting the lives of the entire human
population. Here are pieces of information that may be of utility for
re-examining existing work, and in any event, in the later version, I
will provide more details that relate specifically to The Bell Curve,
and the flaws I’ve noticed that I’ve only more recently been in a
position to provide elucidations for. This work is a preparatory step,
with a collaborative mindset. The finding of flaws would not flaw the
entire work, and could not; and knowing certain flaws, I am not
permitted to join or begin a backlash towards you for your kind and
extremely detailed work, that must have included an incredibly large
amount of your mental time.</p>
<p>Thank you for supporting the intelligence community and the public
with your attempt to compile relevant information that is usable to
anyone who <em>can</em> continue the work. Here you are in the company
of moral philosophers and the sensitive intelligent who are at risk, and
I think it possible to cover all the ethical concerns that any may have
regarding ramifications of true inferences of your materials and related
publications.</p>
<h3
id="thanks-to-mr.-scott-douglas-jacobsen"><a name="thanks-to-mr-scott-douglas-jacobsen">Thanks
to Mr. Scott Douglas Jacobsen</a></h3>
<p>And of course, I thank Mr. Scott Jacobsen for this kind interview
request prompting this writing. I think his efforts will make for a good
comparative study, and will enable us to differentiate between those who
are honest and those who have fabricated for various reasons including
desire for self-elevation. The quality of responses received by
Mr. Jacobsen appear to vary greatly as to quality and veracity. This
interview has given me a chance to share more about my life than I’ve
written before, and this goal is consistent with my <em><a
href="http://www.mattanaw.org">Book and Journal</a></em> that is partly
intended to communicate my living autobiography, and his ethics related
questions are related to the primary purpose of the site to gradually
convey my total system of ethics.</p>
<h3
id="thanks-to-intelligence-community-groups-and-friends"><a name="thanks-to-intelligence-community-groups-and-friends">Thanks
to Intelligence Community Groups and Friends</a></h3>
<p>Within the High Intelligence Groups there are two I want to
especially thank, for their encouragement and friendship. The first is
Mr. William Michael Fightmaster Ph.D., Psy.D, recently deceased, whom I
visited a number of times at his home in Longbeach, California. When I
first joined Mensa, I noticed he was into academic philosophy and
psychology, like myself, and quickly on social media we found ourselves
in many common conversations and engagements of very high quality.
Conversation was better than I experienced in University Philosophy and
Psychology course with peers. Through this quality I think each of us
were able to increase the level of community quality for a large number
of other participants. He was already doing this on behalf of the
community perhaps for years. After his passing the community does not
have the same feel it once did, and I’m appreciative of the time I had
with him, and his support. A friend with a similar interest and
communication style was lost and has not been replaced.</p>
<p>I would also like to thank Mr. Michael Ferguson, who unfortunately
very recently passed as well. He is the author of an article here cited
<em><a
href="http://polymatharchives.blogspot.com/2015/01/the-inappropriately-excluded.html?m=1">The
Inappropriately Excluded</a></em> and his writing has had some influence
on me and seems true to experience of others who are gifted in the high
range, with some agreement to other works discussed in the interview.
Mr. Ferguson was clearly very concerned about encouraging inclusiveness
for very gifted individuals. We did not know each other well, but did
engage in conversation regarding travel, both being retirees. He has
also made numerous contributions to our groups and I’m appreciative of
having had a chance to speak with this influential writer while he was
still living. His passing was unexpected, and it seems he had plans.</p>
<p>I would like to thank Mr. Mark Siegmund, for kind stewardship and
support within Mensa’s EPG-SIG, the Special Interest Group for the
Exceptionally and Profoundly gifted, and Professor Stefan Pettersson of
Mid Sweden University, also for his kind stewardship and support
relating to Mensa Sweden. Special International thanks too to Mensa New
Zealand where I reside part time. Special <em>unthanks</em> to Mensa
Australia, (or their social media gatekeeper) where I also resided, for
<em>blocking</em> me instead of approving the request for entry to a
Mensa Lifetime Member. I was unable to meet and converse with any Mensa
Member in Australia, across much of the country, for having no simple
way to converse with the community there.</p>
<p>Thank you to Professor Terence Tao, from UCLA mathematics, for
various publications to the American Mathematical Society I found
supportive, where we are both members, and for the publication of his
book <em>Analysis I</em>, which supported me on some inroads into the
topic of foundational logic and mathematics, also enabling me with some
direction regarding my <em><a href="http://www.wanattam.com">Theory of
Wanattams</a></em> (pronounced “One Atoms” and “Wan Atoms”), binding
mathematics, computing, logic, to a new view on scientific realism
(Wanattam, 2022).</p>
<p>I want to thank Chris Langan of Mega Society and his wife Gina, for
two reasons. First for permitting my publications that relate to my
study on editing to be published via their Ultranet group, for some
brief but very hospitable chat, and secondly for participating in
Malcolm Gladwell’s book Outliers written partly about him. This section
of the book prompted me to get psychometrically tested again after many
years, after answering the matrix reasoning contained which was
supposedly similar to one provided in a test in which I’m unfamiliar,
but also like what’s in the Raven. After getting retested I finally
joined Mensa in 2014, although I qualified since I was very young.
Parental misdirection resulted in my not being attentive to
opportunities and I only returned to considering it after reading this
book. Of course thanks as well to Mr. Malcolm Gladwell for writing the
book that lead to many personal advancements.</p>
<p>Thanks to Rick Rosner, whom I do not know personally, for introducing
humor into the community and for making it clear that self-education
includes dissertative thinking. I had one humorous interraction with
Mr. Rosner, posting one time that I thought his ingestion of 50 vitamins
a day might be a media stunt. Mrs Peters, mentioned below, introduced
him to the conversation probably to prevent his malignment, which I
agree is a kind move. Mr. Rosner responded, not that he does not ingest
50 vitamins a day, but that he ingests 70! Whether true or not, I now
reflect on this as of highly interesting, and speculate that maybe
Mr. Rosner is studying the reductionism of biology to its most basic
levels as longevity relates to the most basic human life processes.
Ostensibly it already is about longevity, but less obviously its about
penetrating all of one’s personal biology, and he is making himself a
living example. Since I do this sort of thing too, having spent time
tracking my nutrition due to my vegan diet for many years, including
monitoring of some vitamin intake, in what I thought would be my
incipient personal information database, my <em><a
href="http://www.mattanaw.com/mattanaws-personal-form.html">Personal
Form</a></em>. Reading this personal form I recommend using Chrome’s PDF
viewer, scrolling all of the way through to the end to see the
development. This document also indicates a desire for precision and
metrics, in a variety of <a
href="http://www.mattanaw.com/life-categories.html">life’s
categories</a>. This also illustrates my interest in life-artefacts
which is discussed in the interview. I appreciate this from Mr. Rosner,
and especially like his injection of humor even into the most complex of
topics. As I write this I’m more curious to explore what he’s written
for Noesis.</p>
<p>Special thanks to Jonathan Crocker, Ed.D, for kind support on a
number of personal and professional matters, for interesting
conversation on a number of diverse and interesting topics, and for
being an example of positivity in the intelligence community. John and I
chat often, and he has direct access to me at all times over satellite.
I have no cellular. Only 4 people do. He’s a stellar individual.</p>
<p>Special thanks to Nathaniel Bar Fields for many useful introductions
and for his kind stewardship of Elysian Trust, and to Roddy Young of New
Zealand for his hospitality, and discussions which spurred ongoing
thinking that resulted in my concept of <a
href="#dissertative-thinking">dissertative thinking</a>, which relates
to the need of the profoundly gifted to have options for equivalency
doctorates, and enablement for achievement of many doctorates and not
only one. Much is said about my view of dissertative thinking as it
relates to significance and the velocity of ideas in the essay and
interview.</p>
<p>Thanks for Paul Cooijmans, of Giga Society, whom I talked with
regarding my purchasing of one of his tests for the high range, for his
publications against bullying, including his personal history being
bullied for being extremely gifted as a child, and for his interest and
efforts at exploring new ways for those in the higher ranges to achieve
self-understanding. Thanks also for some kind interactions as an
acquaintance on social media.</p>
<p>I would also like to thank my many friends, acquaintances, and
readers, who have provided good encouragement over the years, and
rewarding conversation in and from Mensa, Intertel, Elysian Trust,
Triple Nine Society, Prometheus, Olympic, and Mega, and others. Special
thanks to Karyn Huntting Peters, Editor and Former President of
Prometheus Society, and the skilled admin team at HighIQ World, for
founding and running an extra special community that has provided many
exceptional experiences, online and face-to-face, making my venture into
the high intelligence community in 2014 especially worthwhile and
welcoming.</p>
<p>I am also thankful for my various societal memberships and groups
themselves, and will discuss my views concerning the benefits of Mensa
when that question arises below, in the main interview.</p>
<p>For those who are omitted, don’t think I did not think of you or
won’t! I have a large network especially of former colleagues and have
to spend time finding a way to include everyone.</p>
<h3
id="brief-thanks-to-selected-colleagues"><a name="brief-thanks-to-selected-colleagues">Brief
Thanks to Selected Colleagues</a></h3>
<p>I have had so many colleagues over the years it will be a great
challenge to select, so firstly I just want to thank all who have been
kind and supportive in various ways. In the future, since more time will
be available, for the upcoming print copy of this book, I will be able
to include more individuals.</p>
<p>Thanks to David Hassoun and June Heider of Dolby Labs. These two
colleagues and customers were of great support over the years, and I’m
glad to still have great relations with them since our first meeting to
collaborate on a <a
href="http://www.mattanaw.org/19112019-jun-heider-recommendation-of-matt-cavanaugh.pdf">digital
evidence solution between Adobe and Motorola Systems in which I was
functioning as Chief Architect</a>. Both David and June were running
RealEyes Media, a trusted company that was a partner of Adobe on a
number of <em>extremely</em> important initiatives. I was happy to
discover they were acquired by Dolby in the somewhat recent past. Before
the acquisition I was happy to provide kind support having them and
their clients as customers. They are very intelligent people and I’m
glad to have them around to potentially talk with, even if there are
some passages of time.</p>
<p>Thanks to Brian Paget, creator and CEO of MeetMoji.com, former
CTO-team at Adobe, CTO at SAP NS2, and Executive at Amazon. I’ve had the
unique opportunity to support his recent efforts on an interesting
strartup I think others should know about called MeetMoji, which creates
better communication and engagement with personality, enhancing software
like Teams and Zoom that became especially popular during the
coronavirus outbreak, making remote contact necessary! He’s extremely
intelligent and pleasant to talk with, and builds on conversation in a
way that is uncommon, highly collaborative, and kind, exhibiting strong
velocity of significance and ideation, which is the subject matter of
this paper. I can see his product MeetMoji that is intended to provide
inclusiveness and increased opportunity for self-expression, relating to
the StopBullying Campaign, discussed in my thanks to FLOTUS/POTUS.</p>
<p>Thanks to Adam Kris, for many years working together on deals with
stellar people. Work with Adam has supported the growth of both my
company and my understanding of software related contract law and legal
services. Without him I would not have met some of the amazing people
and organizations I was able to be involved, including Mayo Clinic.</p>
<h3
id="thanks-to-my-many-lawyers"><a name="thanks-to-my-many-lawyers">Thanks
to My Many Lawyers</a></h3>
<p>I would like to thank my Lawyers, Robert Regis, Tom Amodio, Kevin
Boots, Kevin Fitzgerald, and Jimmy White for various areas of support
over the last six years. Without your assistance I would still feel
attacked by politicians and activists, and feel much more safe and
comfortable than if I did not have your support. I speak to an extent on
my handling of my Divorce proceedings, and my Land Related Case that had
media and political attention, as you know, while I was a politician, in
the State of Alaska. As a result I’m a trained lawyer, pro-se of course,
but I could not have achieved that without your mentorship, and critical
protections in times where acting on my own behalf is impossible.
Sometimes I wonder how you all feel about the observation and re-use of
legal materials, although I learned it is somewhat normal in the
profession. Thank you for any examples of quality you’ve provided.
Probably you did not expect being included on an article related to
immeasurable intelligence, but this is who you were protecting and it
will do good for the intelligence community at large, and the public,
since this writing offers them special protections for
self-understanding. The risks posed to my well-being were not only due
to the politicians and activists, who are extremely numerous and
dangerous, simply targeting me for having acquired a property creating
social status, but activists and neighbors who became jealously aware of
my intelligence and friends and family who turned on me during divorce.
Additionally there were <em>entirely unrelated</em> social attacks
digitally from people scattered across a number of countries, and while
I can deal with that I cannot deal with everything. Huge incredible
thank you! You are all personally amazing and noticeably highly
intelligent, and are great people to know and talk to.</p>
<p>Additionally, as a result of this publication I may need your ongoing
aid and assistance, since attacks come from all over, and your domains
of expertise each come into relation.</p>
<p>It was an interesting experience having various financial and
personal documents exposed as a result of this action, but this was not
incompatible anyways with my extreme level of transparency and openness,
which is already on my <em><a

Identity</a></em>. This turned out favorably, and will be incorporated
into *<a href="http://www.mattanaw.org">My Book and Journal</a> further.
But presciently perhaps, there may have work to do regarding others, to
add some humor!</p>

to the First Lady and President, Michelle and Barack Obama</a></h3>
<p>An extra special thanks must be provided to the individuals who
provided me opportunity to deliver on an initiative they created that is
of great importance, the <a
href="http://www.stopbullying.gov">StopBullying campaign</a>, Michelle
and Barack Obama. While working at <a
href="http://www.mattanaw.org/21112019-sunil-bobby-porter-recommendation-of-matt-cavanaugh-two.pdf">ASPA
for the Secretary of Health</a> in 2010/2011, then Secretary Sebelius, I
had an opportunity in a key role, to complete and deliver the
StopBullying website under tight deadline. In this job I was also
delivering PR materials for various other politicians of significance.
The completion and release of StopyBullying.gov enabled me the pleasure
to provide the steps necessary for a new announcement of this campaign
publicly, and it was amazing to see the President and First Lady
announcing my finished product on television together, speaking about
the importance of reducing bullying and for providing assistance to
those who may be experiencing chronic harassment, especially
children.</p>
<p>I recall this work and now think about the relevance of that
campaign, that is still living, and what it means for gifted education
and protection of the minds of the profoundly intelligent, which is
relevant to this publication. The profoundly gifted are often those who
are profoundly sensitive and have a greater understanding and
appreciation of ethics and care, and are willing to support others who
don’t exhibit that same level of giftedness, in the full range of
individuals from those who may be disabled to the very smartest people
who might be their peers.</p>
<p>As President and First Lady, I know you were both bullied too, by
members of the public who are disrespectful to their own process
outcomes of voting. As a politician in the state of Alaska, I too faced
extreme bullying and have at least some understanding of what you may
have experienced yourselves. It is odd that a campaign to support
everyone regarding harassment would apply to the public harassment of
those who kindly created it.</p>
<p>I was fortunate to work on your behalf for other initiatives closer
to your direct experience, like your <a
href="http://www.mattanaw.org/21112019-sunil-bobby-porter-recommendation-of-matt-cavanaugh-two.pdf">HealthCare.gov</a>
initiative, and other efforts relating to subsequent presidents too,
later, which I am grateful for. These other ones cannot be mentioned in
this document at present, but relates to security and briefing, for your
administration and inheriting administrations. There is a legacy!</p>
<p>Our <a href="http://www.stopbullying.gov">Stop Bullying</a> work
relates directly to managing various threats that could exist from
individuals who become dangerous bullies. Experiencing first-hand many
dangerous situations being targeted myself, for bullying by adults in
various communities mentioned later, I’m aware that the importance of
this campaign extends into adulthood into death.</p>
<p>Again many thanks to the President and First Lady, two obviously
highly intelligent and compassionate figures, who indirectly involved me
in this project delivering a message that is now more important to me
than it ever has been, over a decade later.</p>
<h3
id="thanks-to-friends-and-family"><a name="thanks-to-friends-and-family">Thanks

<p>I would like to give special thanks to Alex Karakcheyev, Robert
Calabro and their families including their extended families for great
times over the years and abundant support. They were both colleagues at
Health and Human Services who remain good friends to this day. Robert
actually mentioned to me at work that I should consider joining Mensa,
without knowing I had already been tested as a small child. Upon
mentioning it I wasn’t sure if I should say I was tested, so didn’t
mention it. Later recollections of this conversation contributed to my
inclination to get tested later, but was a more distal catalyst since so
much time had elapsed before my later adult tests.</p>

Note Regarding Applicability of this Essay’s Contents</a></h3>
<p>Those organizations and people I mention in my acknowledgements who
have relationships with the high intelligence community are not immune
in any way from the considerations in this paper, which applies both to
myself and everyone else, which is important for me to state since even
though I have ample respect, especially for those I acknowledge, I do
not have so much respect as to fail to apply truthful thinking to all
contexts; what is favorable is ready to be received by others, but this
paper must cover some that is unfavorable, and whatever happens to apply
and does apply, does apply. I apply this style of thinking, too, to
politics and nationalism, and I’m strongly non-nationalistic. That I’m
from the United States does not immune the United States in any way from
my critical thinking and any truths that may be applied or even borrowed
or learned in other nations. Anyone in the communities, like other large
groups, must be aware of limitations of their groups and individuals
contained. Like in the workplace, sometimes cultishness grows under a
brand, and people become brand enthusiasts and allocate trust
incorrectly to all within and all guiding that brand. It’s like the
workplace that speaks for all employees in public relations stating that
as a rule they only have particular values, which of course were
invented by those workplaces. Employee behavior is explained away, and
the organization pretends propaganda results in uniform elimination of
crime and poor ethics. There is nothing that I am not willing to apply
true thinking to, including to friends and supportive organizations that
have characteristics that are dubious, for whatever is specifically
dubious. That is important regarding the objective of the interview, to
convey the various ways that one might be scammed in groups that contain
people who lie to you, and to us. If this were not the case, there would
be a prescriptive reason separate from behavior that could be provided,
that would state something like “everyone in our group and its founder
would never do that” which is strictly unintelligent prejudice. If such
were true, then there would be a very great level of goodness that would
separate the group from the general population, that consistently
exhibits misbehavior. Questions that exist in this interview would not
be posed to me, if there were not <em>existing</em> risks of
cultishness, crime, scamming, and personal or group fraud. Probably
everyone reading this now has been subjected to some kind of digital
harassment and it is a mistake to think this and other behaviors would
be absent from all groups at a certain size.</p>
<p>The above may sound somewhat harsh, but is ethically upright, and is
simple intelligent thinking about one’s context, and includes a
willingness to let anything that is applicable apply to whatever it
applies to. Else one is not scientific. All that is healthy, safe,
helpful, honest, and truthful, is also applicable wherever it applies,
and it certainly applies to the people mentioned above with variety and
specificity which is the cause for their being included in the
Acknowledgement, and for this I’m quite thankful. People and groups are
divisible and sometimes an admixture of the above is present, and it is
my view that we ought to think about communities with this in view,
without having a prescriptive blanket outlook, that all that a
particular group or society does, is consistent goodness. In this way
most of our culture can and should be criticized, and without thinking
thusly, the intelligent mind is blocking its own inclinations.</p>

<h2 id="abstract"><a name="abstract">Abstract</a></h2>
<p>This paper discusses the thesis that the clearest treatment of human
similarities and differences assumes
propositions<sup><a href="#10">10</a></sup> that are contrary to what
has been assumed in equalitarian culture.<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup>
Bluntly stated, Inequality is self-evident while Equality is not, and
equality must be understood largely through an understanding of
inequality, and not vice-versa. Replacement propositions These
propositions include that people taken individually are unequal on
almost any individual measure that is of interest regarding their
traits, at high precision especially, but also often or usually even at
low precision<sup><a name="#5">5</a></sup>. Taking people to be complex
objects that are the complete combination of their measurable biology,
they are clearly unequal as wholes, which are aggregates of individual
measurable characteristics, causing doctors to provide separate and
individual treatment to patients. Diversity is an expression of specific
inequalities of traits, that are detectable by our sensory systems, upon
comparison of one complex animal and another. Desire and concern for
spreading welfare, and improving social justice, must use true
propositions and not utilize false assumptions, in order to grow and
develop, when that method of development is not contrary to knowledge,
or is not manipulative. Phrases like “human equality” are too simplistic
and do not state what is under comparison or what has been measured. It
appears this is due to our history of advocacy using political slogans,
and our marketing needs related to spreading social advocacy messages.
It appears due to promotion of a political perspective using principles
of advertising and marketing, which do not use complete statements, and
does not rely on truth, but persuasion and repetition. Obstacles to
clarity of knowledge on humans and their welfare needs, and
social-justice systems, requires accurate and true knowledge; and growth
is hoped to be scientific, on learning principles, and not principles of
advertising for attention or simplistic political messaging. What is
true in ideas relating to the desire for social welfare to be
distributed more extensively and in better relation to real needs and
diversity of traits need to be identified. One such truth is that all
people were babies who were unable to control their nature and origins,
and that this truth really does extend to all people universally. This
idea was used, with a pretended application of mathematics, to claim
that humans initially were not only babies, but were globally equal. To
clarify how mathematics would be applied correctly using the truth that
we were all babies, the author prepares the reader first, regarding what
may and may not be considered equal on the basis of measurements, coming
from mathematics. It is discussed that the authority that slogans had on
human similarities were related to a borrowing of authority from
mathematics. This borrowing is not justified where math is not applied.
When applied correctly, it clarifies and does not diminish desire for
spreading welfare among diverse people and situations. It is clarified
when equality is found on earth. Pointers to additional reading from the
present author are given for other developments on the same topic, where
it is too involved or loosely related from the present article. It is
found that inequality is an easy and expected thing to find, whereas,
natural equality is not, particularly where complex objects are becoming
understood in total. ## <a name="preface">Preface</a></p>
<p>This paper was originally planned for publication in 2016, but
misgivings in the method of expression of various points which plainly
contradict the common social worldview lead to my repeatedly wanting to
verify my own perspective and think of alternative ways to make my same
arguments more persuasively, or less provocatively. In my initial drafts
however, I was also aware that people have very ambivalent views
concerning their received views on equality, one moment thinking in a
style that denies equality, while in another mode of thinking, taking it
to be undeniable, and unquestionable. Very few people seemed to have a
subtle perspective akin to my own, and I had the feeling that my
audience was somewhat uniformly going to be against me. My desire to
wait in order to write my opinions on the matter is unusual too. My
website is much against self-restraint on sharing ideas, because my view
is that quick sharing without much concern for editing and manner of
expression tells more about how one really thinks. It also permits a
thinker to share more in a lifetime and not less. My website plainly
exemplifies this point of view as many of my postings do not have spell
check, and have ideas that are very far from being completely worked
out. However, for this article I wanted it to be much more carefully
considered, to have a better chance that my audience would receive the
message more favorably.</p>
<p>If there is anything I wish to convey to the reader it is this: The
thesis of this paper is very well tested. I ask that the reader be as
patient as possibl regardin the development of this topic, since later
portions of the essay provide answers to questions that readers will
have along the way. I expect the reader will disagree with certain early
points, but will find that later clarifications will satisfy their
concerns. A concern of mine while writing was that ordinary experience
would reveal examples that could not be thought of on demand while
sitting and writing. I did have many moments when sudden ideas came to
mind that caused me some stress at thinking my thesis needed revision.
However, careful reflection revealed that this was due to
indoctrination, and initial inability to see how my thesis might relate
more than superficially. Again and again, I thought about it carefully,
and recovered my more careful and rational method of thought which did
prove to show that the thesis really is solid, and apparently does not
have exceptions.</p>
<p>Knowing that yet more potential objections in imagined
counterexamples will arise in readers, I do welcome additional tests of
the view. What I am wanting to convey to the reader, is that many tests
have been conducted, and it will not be an easy task, to instantly
contradict this position. It is much stronger position than might
immediately be recognized. Particularly who one is in the traditional
mindset that is accepting somewhat unreflectively of equality, and not
those other mindsets where you would deny them. I’m not sure there are
many people in the United States or in Western Democracies who do not
have incompatible strongly held convictions about equality that go for
and against received traditions.</p>
<p>This paper intends to clarify it by denying that the form of equality
that is desired can exist, and that our mindset that shifts away from
equality is the one that is closer to the truth of the matter.</p>
<p>The style of this paper is partly academic, and partly
conversational. More conversational discussion will lead the reader into
the topic, in a style more akin to what exists in popular works. Readers
may be persuaded before the work proceeds to more technical discussion,
in a more academic format, which provides increasing substantiation of
what is stated earlier in the essay.</p>
<p><em>Some comments regarding literature review are desirable.</em>
This is a topic I’ve thought about and studied in a variety of contexts,
some of which are abstruse and extremely complex. I am well aware, for
example, of studies in mathematical logic which are intended to provide
foundations for the concept of equality, in trying to define natural
numbers, and basic arithmetic, using logic. I do not rely on these
studies for direct reference, but have been informed by my experience
regarding them. Logical Atomism and Number Theory are interesting
subjects that illustrate that even equality as a concept in mathematics
can be contended, and requires demonstration or proof. Work on this
topic is slow and torturous, since very few are sufficiently technically
able to develop upon earlier progressions. It includes the work of
authors like Gottlob Frege, Alfred North Whitehead, Bertrand Russell,
Guiseppe Peano, Kurt Gödel, Terence Tao and myself. I have other
writings in progress which touch on this work more directly.</p>
<p><em>Definitions are especially important in this paper, and more than
15 scientific reference books for physics and mathematics were checked
regarding definitions of equality.</em> The finding was that each
reference book assumed and did not define what equality was
mathematically, trusting that the mathematical usage of equality was
sufficient to convey what it was. If the reader searches among handbooks
and encyclopedias of physics, chemistry, science, and mathematics, this
observation will be confirmed; that equality is not defined for those
who want to look it up in available books of reference. It seems this
assumption is not unjustifiable, as equality is defined in a somewhat
obscure area of mathematics and logic, and is not the main subject
matter of the reference materials themselves, although one must wonder
why entire fields would be uninterested on what justifies the concept,
for their own knowledge if not for work related utility. The word
equality in mathematics is so trusted that reference materials in the
sciences and physics, and chemistry, do not define what it is. For this
paper, we also do not need to define what equality is in mathematics and
I will trust that all readers have been adequately exposed to the
concept in their early educations. This will be sufficient to illustrate
to the reader how political and social ideas about
Equality<sup><a href="7">7</a></sup> really differ from the mathematical
usage all have been exposed to, but also how it relies upon that
mathematical usage to gain our unreflective confidence.</p>
<h2 id="introduction"><a name="introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p><em>Equality as a social and political movement, has borrowed the
word “equal” from mathematics, in order to seem precise and true without
reflection, but has not retained the clarity required to justify that
borrowing.</em> Because of this, our thinking about the social project
for creating greater fairness and welfare has become vague and
ambiguous, and mostly traditional, and not that innovative. “Human
Equality” or “Equality” in capitalized form have both become a sort of
collective assumption<sup>4</sup>. Everyone has some awareness in which
they superficially agree concerning “Equality” but none can say with
good specificity what it is. This can be contrasted with general
education on elementary mathematics, in which the word “equality” is
used with good clarity. There are historical relationships between
Equality, in uppercase, which is how I’ll designate the socio-political
movement towards fairness, and equality, in the lowercase, which I’ll
designate as the word we are all familiar with from mathematics and the
sciences. The capitalized version of the word equality really does use
the word “equal” with certain purposes we will discuss, and really does
within it have some commitment to something that is more approximately
related to the mathematical meaning of the word, or a roughly
mathematical meaning, which includes sameness, identity, equivalence,
and even alternative usages which are quickly taken to be synonymous,
like egalitarian, equitable, fair, and similar words, which really are
not synonymous.</p>
<p><em>This book calls for a change in language to retain the trust and
authority of mathematics, while discarding what is incorrect in the
political usage, that pretended to have same authority.</em> It is found
that mathematical equality, being the source of the borrowed authority
wanted in political argumentation, is also the required concept needed
to replace the more poor usages of the term. Poor usages of ‘equality’
here are termed ‘faux equality’ or political ‘Equality’ with an
uppercase ‘E’, or ‘the equality if Equalitarian Culture’. The appearance
of either word should signal to the reader that mistakes are made,
requiring replacement with ‘equality’, which is always and only
‘physico-mathematical equality’, to correct those mistakes. By using
physico-mathematical equality in the social context, the authority from
mathematics that was wanted can be preserved, creating clarity in
discussions about justice and fairness, but only with correct usage.
Knowing that the culture has been heavily propagandized using ceremonies
and marketing employing political equality, and has been oft-repeated
pervasively in the news, media and normal communication, it will take a
long time to re-educate. Here we will do some of the work required to
support such a change of language.</p>
<p>*The structure of the argument presented, is a movement from a
description of the errors of the existing utilization, to an exacting
and highly trustworthy new utilization that depends on math and physics,
but is easily understood to all who have been exposed to normal public
education. Key errors are initially described, relating to vagueness of
short statements using the word without making comparisons, to the idea
that ‘All people are created equal’, through to category mistakes,
assuming that if two are ‘human’, by being human they are the same.
After a discussion of these errors, attention shifts to finding the more
correct usage, that depends on mathematical equality. Slowly the
conversation proceeds from basics of equality to equality at higher
complexity, until it is possible to have a conversation about what
equality might really exist in the natural world. While discovering what
equality might exist in the natural world, findings are applied to see
correct usage in the socio-political context. We see how equality might
be used in everyday conversation. Finally we conclude with what is
necessary concerning changes to our view of human equality, to ensure,
that trust and authority of mathematics is preserved, enabling progress
in creating greater social justice and fairness.</p>
<p><em>There are a variety of words which have similar meanings that are
used in substitution for one another when one word feels like it has
been overused in conversation, or when one used often is not quite
fitting–but they don’t really mean quite the same things.</em> For
example, if “equal” is used too repetitively, or seems too strong, one
may use instead equitable, or equivalent, and so on. Using equitable,
one has used a word that is not quite synonymous, and sometimes it is an
admission that there isn’t actually an equality but something close to
equality. It is used as a substitute, but is also used to indicate less
commitment to sameness in what is being communicated. Using words as a
synonym for equal that mean instead “approximately equal” implies that
there is some understanding that exacting equality in what is compared
doesn’t really exist. There are other words often used similarly, like
“balanced”, “proportional”, “congruous”, and many other words that the
reader is likely able to think of, and remembers using.</p>
<p><em>Each of these terms that are used in alternation when talking
about Equality<sup><a href="7">7</a></sup> as a socio-political project,
except “just”, or “fair” really do have a usage which is stemming from
mathematics or the sciences.<sup><a href="6">6</a></sup></em> In math
class, we know that congruent, equivalence, equality, have similar
meanings that are precise only in mathematics, but within math, the
words fair and just are more seldom used.<sup>6</sup> Within mathematics
they are not substitutes for one another.<sup><a name="5">5</a></sup>
The employment of these terms from mathematics is not accidental. There
is an idea that fairness would have a balance of sorts and that a
balance would have a mathematical computation which would reveal
something close to equality. The “balance of justice” is a symbol which
shows equal distribution of moneys which on a balance or scale would
show parity (another word which roughly means equality. I will add them
as more come to mind throughout the remainder of this article). Justness
symbolically to us is illustrated in fair allocation of money, which
does seem to have an expectation of mathematical equality. A fair two
sided balancing scale will not be level if one side does not equal the
other in measure of weight, if calculations are made at a level that is
not too precise for the scale. If we wanted to go further than the
precision of a scale, we would start to say that sufficient parity
exists or sufficient equitability exists, if parties who are seeking a
justness in financial allocation are not concerned about any additional
level of precision, or they are willing to overlook more precision for
being reasonable with each other as to the methods used.</p>
<p>There are many interactions in which this type of Equitability or
Equality really is considered and felt to be just and fair. If one
engages in a sales transaction with a business and purchases what is
really wanted and desired at a price that feels fair given knowledge of
the market, and methods employed at negotiation or arriving at a price,
which may be fixed or predetermined, then both parties may really feel
that a fair and even happy result was arrived at. There can be great
pleasantness at arriving at an equitable deal.</p>
<p>However, in our social customs in conversation and discourse in the
media and with one another on very many other topics which are much more
ambiguous, we still employ those same concepts that are better used in
areas where some precision is possible. In these areas, we become much
more inexact in our language, and somewhat ambiguous, and sometimes
unfortunately, even largely meaningless, as I will later show. This more
poor usage relates to our use to the capitalized Equality, or phrase
“human equality”, with specific things missing which would otherwise
give clarity to the conversation, which exist in other experiences which
really do make such words more accurately usable.</p>
<p>When we say Equality, and I was guilty of this error for a long time,
because I was conforming to popular usage, we do not really state what
it is that is under consideration. If I say this to someone in public, I
would anticipate though, a quick response: “Well, you are supposed to
already know what that means and what is under consideration.” I know
that though, and that is why here I have taken the step to capitalize
it. Conversation cannot go further to show what is really erroneous in
this way of thinking, if I cannot take steps though, to show that
certain omissions need to be revealed to provide a more clear
understanding that this is not a way of speaking that provides the same
confidence and clarity as the symbol of the balance and finding of
equality in transactions which really do allow for accuracy. If this
Equality is challenged, what people will begin to want to react with are
assumptions about your worldview which are false. They will want to say
that you don’t believe in fairness, or justness. That you don’t believe
that an improved equitability of sorts in human comparisons is not
beneficial. But they would say this while missing that you really do,
and you are thinking about this, perhaps like me, because you want to
fix something that would block us from going further in that direction.
The conversation has to go further than these obstacles in order to
clearly communicate what must be improved and what errors might exist,
and these initial objections are really hard to get past, because people
really do begin to think that you might be somehow aggressively against
them, while fascinatingly, knowing what is wrong with Equality really
might mean that you are more for them than they would realize, thinking
the way they are thinking. It is really unfortunate that conversations
might end on this type of objection.</p>
<p>I wish to get into this topic faster to get to the details, but one
more obstacle to a more complete analysis must be shared. And that’s
that early thinkers, and originators of political documents, and now
debunked political philosophies, have been sloppy with their usage of
their marketing slogans on social fairness and justness, and that is one
reason why we are in a predicament around capitalized Equality. We have
treated certain documents as authorities on this, and have been raised
on equality being axiomatic and self-evident, and the like. In the
Declaration of Independence of the United States we hear things like “we
take these truths to be self-evident” which again relates social justice
to mathematics. The non-mathematician may not be aware that using the
word “self-evident” is really another way to borrow precision from
mathematics. Some statements in mathematical proofs are taken to be
intuitively axiomatic or self-evident, in that they are logically
irrefutable or simple in their veracity. It’s another way of saying “No
mathematician would seriously challenge these logical transitions, or
these simple statements.” However, social theorists like Thomas
Jefferson have utilized these same words and constructions in settings
where they are not admissible. The purpose of this usage is to give the
reader the impression that such statements cannot be contradicted. And
in a statement to an adversary saying “we hold these truths to be
self-evident” is like saying “there really is no conversation to be had
any longer on this topic.” For the present conversation, some have
really been raised to believe vague and ambiguous ideas about Equality
outside any context which permits of high accuracy are still,
nevertheless, to be accepted as self-evident or axiomatic, forgetting
that with decreased clarity of situation and applicability of terms, the
meaningfulness of the statements and the concepts begin to erode. This
is very opposite to the intention of self-evidence and axiomaticity in
mathematics, and in these situations, the mathematical certainty cannot
be borrowed. There really is a point in which Equality is something that
should be separated in one’s mind, from precision and math, and trust.
Equality really can be used in a way that is not trustworthy.</p>
<p>Here we come to an uncomfortable conclusion though:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“But we have the word equal within Equality.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which is <em>very</em> uncomfortable. It implies that as we use the
word Equality outside of an area where there is precision, we are still
using a word that is very closely connected with mathematics, and trust,
and we are at risk of being deceived. We are at risk of thinking that
wherever the word equal is used, something has been proven. However,
mathematicians are aware that work must be shown to be accurate to
demonstrate that equality has been arrived at, using the correct
mathematical methods and rules of logic.</p>
<p>I would like to be able to convey to the reader that our predicament
on this is not yet worse.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Equality in math is taken as an axiom in math, which really does
mean that of anything that can be tainted in math, this is what ought
not be blemished.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We will in this paper explore the mathematical concept of equality,
and we will arise at the conclusion, that people have not striven to
define it. It is precisely one of those areas where self-evidence is
employed. It may even be one of the few areas where we can understand
what an axiom and self-evidence really is.</p>
<p>In this paper I will strive to clarify what is happening here, and
how we can move forward. I will uncover some points which I think will
reveal that we will be in social discomforts for a long time, to recover
from an erroneous way of thinking, an to eventually stumble and arrive
at a more clear way of thinking and talking on this topic. But more
importantly I will provide what is also a satisfying and contenting
answer, which should allow us to more precisely create fairness and
social justness, on a way of thinking that gets past some obstacles like
these which I pointed out earlier.</p>

<p>Words like equality, in mathematics, have a special place regarding
expectation of precision, which comes from a long history of
interdisciplinary accomplishments, using methods of proof which appear
among the best that humans have been able to arrive at. If trust we have
in mathematics is to be borrowed for alternative usage, for political
purposes, by politicians and others advancing politics, it must explain
why the trust should be extended to their purposes, and the usage must
be clear and unvague, carrying over precision which existed in
mathematics. Political conversation is not mathematics. Globally humans
have arrived at an appreciation for math, and many groups of people have
made contributions to what is now the total works that comprise
mathematics as a whole. Equality, the movement coming from equalitarian
culture, borrows this word that has special precision, but does not
itself utilize the same mathematical methods which have been trusted;
instead, it borrows the word to create a feeling of trust that exists in
mathematics, for other purposes related to development of justice,
wherever it has been honest in its intentions. In my thinking, if the
word equality is utilized, its employment must be mathematical, or else
it’s borrowing must be justified. Particularly if it is going to inherit
special status that has been created in mathematics, but not where it
will be employed. Equalitarian culture, if pressed to explain the
relationship of Equality with equality, has difficulty making the
coneection; it is unable to explain what is mathematical about the
Equality which is a vision of sorts, regarding social justice. If people
are asked to explain Equality, they begin to speak with vagueness.
Explanations become ambiguous. Ambiguity is not something that is
allowed in mathematics regarding equality, and for this reason there
must be a very good explanation for borrowing the word, otherwise damage
to mathematics itself is being done. There is an erosion on an
understanding of what makes equality special, and mostly trustworthy
without criticism. In my own thinking I will not permit a concept to
have a special status, like Equality, if I cannot very precisely explain
its meaning, without vagueness. I will show various reasons why Equality
is too vague, and this will explain why I cannot give it a special
status.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this article I will go along with our trust in
mathematics and assume that the concept of equality is really as
trustworthy as other mathematicians have assumed. I will not here be
questioning word equality as it is used in mathematics, although I do
and will elsewhere, in other writings onmathematics. Because the trust
in equality is so strong in mathematics, people will overlook that
although equality has been extremely useful, there are issues with its
definition, and manner of usage, even within math. I do not consider the
concept of equality to be one that is sacrosanct even within mathematics
and the sciences, and in my other writings on mathematics, and works in
progress, I challenge even our very basic idea of mathematical equality,
so even this concept is not something that one cannot strive to
understand in greater detail, and make criticisms and find issues
regarding. However, for now I will share that the mathematical idea of
equality really does, to me, have a level of precision that is the cause
for our wanting to utilize it elsewhere. We have inherited an error,
however, in that it cannot be borrowed as frequently and in as many ways
as we have borrowed it, wherever we have been outside of mathematics and
in discussions that are imprecise.</p>
<p>Now recognizing that equality really is considered special because of
our usage within the disciplines of mathematics and the sciences, and in
everyday uses which seem confirmed again and again, we can now turn our
attention to its usage in social life. Especially in politics, and the
advancement of political agendas, like Equality. One might ask:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Outside of math, in our use of Equality, in social life, how have we
been vague and ambiguous?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For this let us recognize that people are not uniformly in agreement
regarding politics, and in our own conversations regarding equality, we
should be able to recall differences of opinion. Notice that in social
life, and in politics, we are in a party system in which one group
typically opposes another regarding political views. We can expect, that
people really will have differing views about what Equality is and what
implications about it are. In practice we do expect and anticipate that
what people may think about equality will vary, and we cannot expect
that people will be in agreement about what Equality is in particular
and what its details are. Also, I want to revisit that I mentioned that
the reader in many contexts really does disagree about certain social
uses of the word “equal”. I bring this up to prepare the reader not to
be too disagreeable concerning areas in which we’ve come to assume that
Equality is clear and not vague, by mentioning that, really there are
many occasions in which we don’t agree on social equality, and in many
ways we don’t even want it.</p>
<p>Sometimes people are forgetful about other parts of life in which
equality is not something that is assumed, but rather, inequality is
what is assumed and expected, like in competitive situations, like
sports, education, and work. In competition, we want to see and
experience the very best examples of human ability. In our rewards of
other people, and in our expectation on receiving rewards, we have an
idea that there can be very large differences between people, that call
for very different rewards. We celebrate certain great successes in
business and are often unconcerned about how business people are
rewarded. We celebrate athleticism and amazing productions of art and
entertainment, and seem to want to praise and provide better lives to
those who seem to enrich our lives by their excellences. Here it is very
clear that what we don’t want is human equality. We want to experience
something different, unique traits that are awesome and powerful and
surprising. We want to be entertained by uniqueness. We celebrate the
greatnesses that are only possible with diversities. We want to see all
the differences that people have in all their traits. We are aware that
many really do have weaknesses and traits that we do not desire by
comparison, and that contrasts can be very large. We celebrate the
special olympics through examples of highest physical achievement,
pairing olympic gold medalists in regular olympic games with those of
the special olympics. We want to see great traits expressed even in
people who have other traits we do not find desirable, and even
consider, in private moments, to be really unfortunate or even
disastrous. We want to see our children born with beauties exceeding the
beauties of others. We do not want to see that they are malformed, or
that they will have serious deficiencies, which may affect their minds,
and quality of life in the key traits which we use to demarcate human
life from the lives of our other non-human animal relatives. We prefer
being humans over what other life nature shows us.</p>
<p>If we consider that we really do see diversity in life, and that we
value excellences, and disklike greatly certain unexcellences, we really
can see we <em>want</em> certain kinds of inequalities. We want to
experience the beauties of excellences and notice differences from
unexcellences. Also, we want to reward those who are virtuous and
display good characteristics and actions, but we want to punish or not
reward those who exhibit traits we dislike and abhor. We even want to
ignore or overlook things which are more plain and mundane in our
environments as “nothing special” or as undeserving of praise or
lingering attention. In many ways I think it is irrefutable that we
really do often see that people are unequal, if we are to do real
comparisons, and not only that, we don’t want to be equal on those
comparisons. This is why I think sometimes we are really uncomfortable
on the topic of equality. I think some may be like me, feeling unable to
share, that really there is something not quite right in our socially
received view of Equality, and that this is because on one side we
really do want people to have enjoyable and rewarding lives, whatever
their differences happen to be, and that we really do like people who
are different from us, and want to allocate our care and concern for
others somewhat apart from our knowing everyone is different, while
simultaneously wanting to reward certain excellences greatly. What has
not yet been considered here, is that we also want to take away and
punish people, and not reward, traits which we happen to dislike, which
may nevertheless be natural, and part the full diverse expression of
human traits.</p>
<p>People do not appear to want to maintain in all situations their
belief in Equality. Rather, there are times in which they want to repeat
traditional ways of thinking, and maybe celebrate cultural attainments
which relate. However, there are numerous situations in which they will
transition to another way of thinking which values diversity and
inequalities. I don’t think people can on all occasions in which social
justice comes up, always utilize the same ideas that exist in Equality.
People will alternate positions depending on the context. If it is about
sports, people will suddenly forget equalitarian culture. If it is about
national competitions, including conversation about warfare, they will
forget equalitarian cutlure and will side typically with advancing their
own cultures survival or dominance. If people are talking at work about
who gets promoted and who does not, they will not want to focus on the
Equalities which might result in a drive to keep people at the same
level of pay and title. Instead, they will move to a more competitive
mindset, and think it unfair if one cannot advance, or does not advance
according the interpersonal differences, which means diversities, and
inequalities.</p>
<p>There is also a very strong belief that people ought to self improve.
People enjoy learning, and making themselves feel stronger, smarter,
more moral, and more viruous. It has been overlooked, I have found in my
conversations since I was a teen, that self improvement implies that one
has become better than one was. Some are so satisfied with their results
of their work on themselves over years, that they would even complain
about who they once were, thinking themselves much less than what
they’ve become. This is greatly at odds with the views of Equality,
since one already believes that one can be quite dissimilar in value to
oneself over time. If one is better after making self improvements, then
anyone who was similar to the former self, than the later self, will be
considered someone who is not as high in value. One makes social
comparisons to verify that one’s self-improvements seem to mean that one
has improved. “Before, I was like these other people, in these various
ways. But now, I’m much better than I was, and much better than they are
also.”</p>
<p>Social comparisons imply that one is seeking to find differences that
relate to relative value differences. In competitions relating to
sexuality, and appearance, and ability approval and disapproval in
others, one can see again that people do not really want Equality.
Again, they want attractive mates, mates that are powerful and strong
(if women), and want people who are not average, or below average, as
much as those who are excellent and display many virtues, and good
traits. Furthermore, this is not something people are showing a trend
that they do not want it; instead, there is, and has been in all
history, a trend that people really want this to remain. Changing
sexuality and inclinations regarding attractiveness to be more
harmonious with Equality does not seem a goal people have. Instead,
people are seeking out what appears special, more beautiful, more
compatible with their aesthetic preferences. They are highly interested
in somethings while they exclude all others. They must choose a single
partner, and not have many, and they really do wish their partner is one
that is perhaps, better than they can even have for themselves. This
does cause people to recognize that the traits they have may not be as
valuable as the traits others really do have, that they may really want
for themselves, and choose if they had the ability to. In life they did
not have such a choice at the outset. In the future, it may really
become possible for people to choose their traits to a greater extent,
and given easy options, they will make those choices indicating they do
not think what they could be is equal with what they are before making a
choice. People really do have the ability to select some traits but with
difficulty if it is something durable. For example, men will want to be
more athletic, stonger, and show better musculature. If it seems
reasonably within reach, people will work hard to have it. However,
there are examples in which it was attained even with very laborious
efforts, particularly in bodybuilding, by people who looked and behaved
very differently earlier than later. Bodybuilders would not agree that
their fomer selves are as valuable as their later selves. The many fans,
followers, and learners that give them attention indicate that they do
not value themselves as much as the bodybuilders, in many ways, and that
if they attained similar appearances, they would be much better than
they are.</p>
<p>Returning to work life, we can see also that we value those who have
advanced very far, and if we are women we include that in our appraisal
of them as good candidates for mating and for relationships. While at
work, we want to be rewarded if we show certain traits and progressions
ourselves, which seem akin to those already existing in others who have
advanced, and are supposedly successful on their merits. Those who are
successful on their merits are greatly interested in creating an
appearance that it really was from their merits, to exhibit their
attainment of greater value in a way that is agreeable to workers. It
seems really clear that in work life, we think people merit advancement
on their self improvements. When someone learns, and performs well, and
increases knowledge and productivity, and succcess, they are better and
not equal to their earlier selves, in ways that are plainly measurable.
When you finish your education, and your career, you really are
measurably an improvement from your earlier self. On these areas where
you have merits and excellences that are rewarded, you also think you
have benefits, and advantages, and measurable qualities, that since they
are better than they were, for you, are certainly better than everyone
else, where they are in the same position you were. A doctor will
consider themselves to be an advancement on when they weren’t doctors
and measurably better in various ways, than those starting out in the
same level of ignorance, and readiness for improvement. There isn’t any
reason to pretend that finishing is equal to starting, on all those
points where finishing was suppose to be a development goal.</p>
<p>Earlier I have stated that my perspective regarding the present topic
is one that is well tested. I really have thought about what might
challenge this point of view in real life, where we often find
counterexamples to views we thought were global. Our views are tested by
the diversity of experience in real life which cannot be tested in any
other way. In our minds, we try to survey all scenarios, but in practice
do occasionally recognize contradictions and incompatibilities,
sometimes in views we think are good, and are solid. I have taken
special effort to ensure that years of life experience tested this view
because I know it is one that is considered, on tradition, one that is
sufficiently compared to the variety of experiences we all have. For
this reason I have been careful to compare it with other parts of life
that do not really usually bring to mind equalitarian culture, like
sporting events, nationalistic pride and celebrations of military
victory, work life which appears less democratic, our love of good
entertainment and entertainers, our sexuality and values concerning
attractiveness and desirability of mates, and competition more
generally. Surveying life, and my own experiences, I have found that we
are largely ambivalent in our views about Equality, and we really do
value inequalities in one type of context, which is competitive, and
switch to another type of view, when the context involves political
agendas, and involves celebrations about what has been achieved by
certain political movements. One is in favor of diversity and the other
is in favor of Equality.</p>
<p>These two types of thinking explain why people alternate in worldview
in different situations, and why they may occasionally become annoyed
about the topic. I think the reader may begin to alternate in mind
between thinking that people are Equal in some way that is more vague
and ambiguous, but social, relating to justice, but will also think, in
a work and competitive context, that they are better in various ways. I
would like the reader to reflect that truly, in the area that is
competitive, there truly is something to this view, that the reader has
adopted a position, that will arise in mind over and over again, that is
against human equality and more in favor of diversity. I hope the reader
can admit, that when they are feeling advantages they have, in a
competitive context, they are thinking they have a betterness, which is
measured by the competition, that relates to diverse allocation of
traits. In other words, reflect on how you can win and perhaps become a
winner, without having some trait allocation which others have not
benefited from. You are an expression of diversity and you have a
benefit of an inequality which favors you in competitive measures.</p>
<p>Winning, over time, implies having special skills or traits that
resulted in frequent victories. You cannot win in chess over and over,
or wrestling, or in beauty competitions, without having something others
didn’t have, which are measured to be unequal when one has become a
winner, or champion. Also notice, that for any champions which exist in
the world, there are many who you could never be like, because you have
forever not been given those traits and advantages, and results of work,
which they have gotten. You are measurably and in many ways less, on
specific measures, on specific activities, in which others excel. This
should be an easy admission. I have many advantages but I am not at all
endowed to compete as a pro basketball player in the position of
center.</p>
<p>There is clarity about a desirableness of inequality when thinking
about competitions like sports, and thinking more carefully about our
experiences enjoying sports as spectators, and as athletes, we can come
to a more subtle understanding about what we value about inequality, and
about how that contrasts with Equality. Stats and performance and a
simple view of athletes shows us clearly where measurable difference
exist. Our view about diversity is not challenged by sports, and we feel
nice reflecting on humans strengths which others do not have, and we are
willing to reward some more than others, and think it just, within
tolerances. In sports some are quite enthusiastic about measurement. The
very best athletes are compared on their metrics and their data which we
call stats. We use the measures of these players, which might be pretty
exacting, to try to compare them to see who is really ultimately and
totally best at their particular sport. We want to “total” the measures,
and complete the measurement as to who might be finally considered the
most unequal of all, or that which is most excellent and greatest. This
is something we enjoy and don’t consider to be greatly at odds with our
worldview.</p>
<p>The personal life of an athlete, however, is treated more in the
politial sphere than it is within sporting discussion regarding
measurable skills and accomplishments. As soon as the personal lives of
athletes comes into view, and touches on moral discussion, we do become
more sensitive about wanting to allocate cares in ways that do not
simply relate to their rewards as being measurably better athletes.
Think of athletes who have been accused of crimes, or even athletes who
have been accused of infidelity. This is where vagueness creeps into the
topic, which seems to come from uppercase Equality, and it happens in
many different ways, which are not easy to anticipate, but are routinely
in areas where clarity of measure does not exist in a way which
resembles the clarity of comparison within the sporting context. Clarity
is more obvious when thinkin about measurable differences in sports, and
what is seen in their performances in sporting competitions, and there
is less clarity, when this is intermixed with personal lives, and moral
or political ways of thinking.</p>
<p>Let us consider an example in which an athelete is accused of an
actual legal or moral transgression. We will invent an example so we are
not dwelling on common examples involving real athletes which we
certainly have heard of many times<sup><a name="#2">2</a></sup> Suppose
an athlete is accused of transgressing some social rule and perhaps a
family member of that athlete has been harmed. In that situation we
begin to think that the other person is unfortunate, and we would like
their fortune to be better, and we would like to give them care and
concern which might bring their situation to one that feels just, so
they are doing well again. Their wellness, and our wellness, thinking
ourselves harmed by witnessing injustice, might also be improved, we
thinking, by removing care and concern to the athlete, who is a specimen
of excellence in sporting, but now perhaps seemingly a specimen in
unexcellence in private family life. In this social setting, outside of
the sport, however, we really do lose sense of proportions and become
confused as to what is fair and equitable, not having the measures and
information and stats, and means of comparison, and clear ways of
comparing which exist within the sport. In social life we are much more
confused about how justice is to be allocated, particularly because we
cannot measure.</p>
<p>On the largest scale of human conversation between nations and within
nations when we talk of Human Equality and Equality we have trouble
unfocusing from one topic in isolation, like about sports competitions,
to combining all topics in which they relate to life in general
globally. Nationalistic competition confuses the idea that people have
regarding Equality within their nations. We have already seen, that in a
highly specific scenario of one athlete’s family, we have vagueness. If
we grow that situation to include all people, and all the harms they
have suffered, and benefits they have gotten, and try to allocate cares
and concerns, we are suddenly in the confusion we really are in.
Socio-political life is not one of clarity and science when it is having
discussions about topics like this. It is much more an example of
disorder and confusion, with socially accepted methods of conversing
over the topic. This means that people can have very different ideas
about what the situations are, who should be cared about and when, and
how cares are allocated, and have no measurements at all. We know that
people vary this way in our everyday experience with the news and media,
and in what we hear from others, and what is clear is that there is huge
variety and lack of clarity, and very little data and measurement, and
agreement as to method of comparison. But what is common to all, is that
outside the sporting context where they agree on inequality, they really
do switch to a social agreement about vague rules which require
statements about Equality. One has to state that one believes in a more
general diffuse equality that did not ever do any measurements. In this
vagueness, still however, one is expected to have strong affirmative
beliefs about it. That even with all the diversity we really enjoy,
there is some kind of similarity, or sameness, that we are confusingly
supposed to use, to ensure that cares are allocated in a way that does
not include measurement. In other words it is an odd Equality that is
anti-measurement.</p>
<h2
id="a-brief-statement-on-improving-justice-and-well-being"><a name="a-brief-statement-on-improving-justice-and-well-being">A
Brief Statement on Improving Justice and Well-being</a></h2>
<p>The primary objective of this paper is to overcome an obstacle that
will result in more social justice and not less. I feel I need to
articulate that I am on the side of furthering human welfare, and not
taking away from it. I am strongly opposed to decreasing human welfare,
and feel it somewhat strange that I would need to much a statement.
However, many think that changing views regarding Equality would somehow
result in decresing human well being, or somehow imply that the writer
is someone of a deplorable character, not wanting progress on feeling
good generally, but an actual desire to make humans feel worse,
globally. I am wanting to improve the condition of people who have not
received good allocation of care, and resources which would make their
lives better, which would be in keeping with, and prove to an extent,
the reality of the allocation of care. In other words, I don’t want to
say that care should be allocated better. I want their conditions to be
really improved, so that you can say you did care to begin with.</p>
<p>To me commitment to words and terms is greatly unimportant to
improving well-being. I have stated earlier, that part of my thesis is
that we have to get rid of Equality in order to overcome obstacles that
exist, preventing our more clear thinking about social justice. It is my
view, that the vagueness that exists in Equality is something that
blocks our realization of objectives of fairness and justice, which
should not be identified with it. Fairness and justice are not the same
thing as vague Equality. They would be the same as precise forms of
allocations of goods and cares which related to measures which are
mathematical, and being mathematical, employ the type of equality which
we really trust. This is akin to saying we would get scientific about
it. It would also include those things we enjoy in human diversity which
includes things we want to be unequal, on measures similar to those in
competitive sports. This means that our improved view of justice and
fairness would incorporate what we want that implies inequalities which
are desirable. Diversity is a result of inequalities on traits and this
needs to be included and not excluded from thinking about social
justice.</p>
<p>Social justice and general fairness is something I would not succeed
completely describing here. That is not the purpose of this article. The
purpose of this article is to take steps necessary to make it possible
to better articulate what better fairness and justice would consist of.
However, wanting to point in the direction that I most minds rightly
point, when thinking about what is not incorrect or too vague about
social justice, I want to say that repulsive harm to people who simply
have not been given natural benefits in life, or are victims to
repulsive forms of irrelevant prejudices, and nationalities, should have
a better distribution of resources. I personally would go further, to
say that plain victims of cruelty are protected, including human and
non-human animals. To be transparent, I do include animals. I am greatly
in favor of making sure that people who are not getting cared or are
distribute resources in such a way as they would imagine that they were
more completely cared for, and not ignored.</p>
<p>This is somewhat like pointing out that a certain composite imbalance
still exists that is vague, but definitely exists. Some may confusingly
and vaguely state that this is what Equality is. What is happening in
such a claim though is an attempt to preserve that which is creating an
obstacle by saying “look, you are saying that there is a kind of master
general balance that could exist that doesn’t.” I’m merely wanting to
point out, however, that there is something that can be agreed upon
regarding social justice which admits gross inequitabilities, involving
starving children, and extreme wealth differences which appear
unjustified. Such an admission would forget, that one’s mind quickly
switches over to the other side, that sees value in rewarding
professional athletes on merits in a way greatly different from others,
and there isn’t much objection to that. This point here illustrates the
problem. Really the Equality view needs to go away, and more
comprehensive perspective using measures and details which admits that
diversity is inequality is required. Nevertheless, I wanted to remind
the reader, that the objective here is to improve social justice and not
detract from it, even if there are some difficulties changing the way of
speaking about it.</p>
<h3
id="using-birth-to-establish-equality"><a name="using-birth-to-establish-equality">Using
Birth to Establish Equality</a></h3>
<p>There was a period in American and British thinking, certainly not
exclusive in ingenuity to what others have done in human history, but
seemingly new and somewhat unprecedented in political formation and
legal recordings, which focused on what was called “tabula rasa”
psychology, or the psychology that people become what they are based on
experience and begin roughly as unlearned things ready to absorb
experience.</p>
<p>Part of this perspective is one that is instrumental to conveying why
it is important to provide welfare to those who were born without any
experience, like yourself, and myself, but did not receive much
opportunity for experience, or certain physiological advantages. There
is another part of this view, that is unhelpful and works against the
objectives to establish welfare, even when there may be positive intent.
This idea that we were all inexperienced babies, placed on earth in a
strage time and place, each of us in differing places, with differing
bodies, and growth pathways, is useful for conveying what has been in
our control and not, but the idea has been overextended by political
thinkers to imply more than it does, namely that Equality exists. We can
clarify our views on morality and politics by separating what is useful
in this perspective from what is not; what has been beneficial to us in
this idea, from what has not been beneficial.</p>
<p>Here let’s focus on some propositions which appear to be true
regarding this idea that people were all babies initially without
certain important types of life-controls:</p>
<ul>
<li>Everyone was a baby.</li>
<li>All learning animals were babies.</li>
<li>A baby animal will absorb information from its environment,
including biases and cultural information.</li>
<li>Babies are interchangeable regarding relevant types of powerlessness
and non-control.</li>
<li>Who we are is largely not in our
control.<sup><a href="12">12</a></sup></li>
<li>A zygote and infant’s ability to self-modify it’s own physiology is
measurable, and appears to be negligible, even without performing
measurements.</li>
<li>A person’s ability to self-modify during its lifetime appears
measurable, and appears to be greater than those of a zygote or baby’s,
but just as negligible regarding control of preconditions.</li>
<li>All animals die, and have a clear beginning and end to their
life-cycles.</li>
</ul>
<p>Taking each one at a time, let’s see some details about each
proposition.</p>
<p><em>All people really do have a baby-beginning, which means that we
have one really interesting universal piece of information applicable to
all people.</em> This may be one of the most significant and
underutilized fact about life, which does support much that is desired
in sharing welfare amongst all or most people, and animals. The idea is
that no person has any creation related credit for their own bodies and
minds, and position in life, and initial trajectory for learning. Who
you start out as, and who you become, is mostly out of your control. It
is mostly outside of anyone’s control. Moreover, babies really do have
capacities to learn similarly, having similar brains, and similar ways
of interacting with the world; particularly if they are of the same
species. We learn the same languages, and successfully communicate. We
really do have a similar readiness to receive knowledge, and this is
shown by the results and assumptions of our education systems. Knowing
that people are similar in this way, and that there is little merit in
original receiving of genetics, and of placement in a particular region,
and of early upbringing, and trajectory of life, if one is in a really
good position in life, one begins to wonder, if one is caring, how to
care for others who did not have any demerit, which would make them have
less. <em>Everyone was a baby, so why would we not want to provide care
and concern, to others who have really terrible situations at the
least.</em> Personally, I think we should be willing to care for more
than those in the most terrible situations, but observing the world, it
appears we have not done much for the people who are worst off.</p>
<p><em>Any baby can be made to conform to any nationalism.</em> We
anticipate, and expect, that if a baby is born in a specific region,
that they will acquire the views of the nation that claims ownership
that land-region. An implication is that you are of your own nation,
because you were born in a particular region. If a baby is transported
to another nation at birth, they will receive the knowledge, customs,
and assumptions and biases of that nation, and not another. However, it
is understood, that by moving any new baby to any new country, that baby
will absorb that nation, and the primary cause of that would be their
being transported to a region and left there to grow.</p>
<p><em>People are interchangeable with respect to their original life
controls.</em> I could be someone else instead” is a thought that
relates to this observation. Combined with the prior point, if your
identical twin is placed in another nation, they will really become
someone different from you (babies have no knowledge and absorb what is
in their environment), and they will have potentially much less
resources and potential happiness, if that nation is not well developed.
The idea here is that this person really has nearly identical genetic
code to you, but not living beside you where it would appear in time
that they were really as similar to you as something could be, they were
transported to a place, where maybe they age and die early. Knowing this
person was just like you, it is odd to not be concerned about welfare,
if one claims also to be working on welfare. Other people, being only
more dissimilar to you by matter of degree, still were babies, and still
also did not choose or merit living in any one nation or another. Living
in that nation, they may age and die early, and in similar ways, perhaps
to your identical twin!</p>
<p><em>Who we are is largely
predetermined.</em><sup><a href="12">12</a></sup>First you were a baby
of a certain genetic heritage, located in a particular region, where
there were certain customs, and a dominant language, and you were
steered by adults to certain information. You were present to absorb
from your parents, and from messages in your surroundings. Your comforts
were gradually related to your nation, in the type of foods, the
appearances of surroundings, and in your understanding of verbal speech.
You could not understand the languages of other nations. Growing older,
you acquired the mental abilities, formed in this setting, with
properties related to the setting, combined with your genetics, to make
periodic decisions. Throughout your days, you did many behaviors
automatically. You walked along to classes, looked around without
reflecting how to manage your neck, and you became attracted to objects
according to your animal nature. Within this way of behaving, sometimes
you would make selections, between what you could imagine were options,
and what options may have been put in front of you. It already must be
admitted, you do this only periodically. You sit and sleep and act
mostly without actively deciding; when you do decide, you decide on
options and mind that was already prepared for you. This means even when
you are being you, deciding things for which you’d like credit, and some
praise, you are still already relying greatly, mostly, on what was
already there, and this traces back to when you were a baby, when you
could take no credit at all, for your surroundings and your body and
head. Reflecting now, that this is the case for everyone else who
exists, it seems that welfare is not something people could make for
themselves, or deprive themselves of; minds already formed, periodically
making decisions, that create or decrease welfare, are still doing what
they do, based on what was provided before, and what exists in their
thinking abilities, and manner of thinking related to language and
region. The implication is even people who seem to harm themselves are
not really to be thought of as being in control of harming themselves as
much as people imagine makes it something they deserve. Likewise, making
good decisions on the basis of mind and situation generated from
history, does not mean that one merits good things, as much as they
might want to think they do. There is room for merit and demerit but
this is not the location to discuss that point. That will be discussed
elsewhere in another article.</p>
<p><em>A zygote and infant’s ability to self-modify it’s own physiology
is measurable, but we do not expect that they would have much control
even if we measured it.</em> It is uninteresting to measure an infants
ability to self control. We can measure our abilities to control our
physiological compositions at conception, and up through birth, and we
would find that we have very minimal abilities to self-define. We
measurably have no ability to control what has preceded our lives too.
Our abilities to self-define our physiological compositions includes our
instructional information for growth and our compositions later in life.
At time of birth, and in utero, humans really have what can be
summarized as nearly zero influence on their own physiology, excluding
what a baby in utero changes on its decisions regarding its own
behavior, which result in differences even in utero. However, we
consider that to be negligible or due to physiological conditions which
already preexisted or due to an interaction between predecided growth
rules and the environment. The observation that we were all babies, and
that we had very little influence on our environments, has lead us to
mutually conclude that really it seems we had no influence. If measured
it appears our influence is nearly zero, although work on this will
reveal it is not exactly zero, for the many various ways we can
self-influence even in utero. The following propositions seem truthful.
All humans had zero, on all measurements of influence and power, to
control events before birth that were relevant to creation of
physiology, including growth instructions within physiology, that would
control growth and composition that they would later have.</p>
<p><em>A person’s ability to self-modify during its lifetime appears
measurable, and appears to be greater than those of a zygote or baby’s,
but just as negligible regarding control of preconditions.</em> Simply
by getting older, one does not incdrease the influence one did not have
when one was a zygote or baby, for those periods of time before, and
during, that time of being a baby or zygote. This is equivalent to
stating that there is an inability to alter one’s past, and conditions
before one was born. Humans seem to have a tendency to observe the
controls they presently have (which also appear to be not that
powerful), back in time to earlier dates in their lives. In other words,
a successful business man will come to believe that certain decisions or
acts somehow increase power of self-alteration before those powers
existed. Since zygotes and babies appear to have little influence on
their conditions and preconditions, one can notice then that growth and
development along life would seem to increase powers in a way that
appears predictable. This means the growth of powers from greater
powerlessness to more power in life appear measurable. If a baby has
negligible power, then shortly after being a baby, it would appear that
power would be negligible or nearly negligible. It is a task of science
to eventually arive at a clear description of when it becomes less
negligible in anyone’s life, and for some lives certainly it remains
negligible on certain measures.<sup><a href="#13">13</a></sup>. These
considerations provide us reasons for having similar thoughts about the
conditions of life that people have when they are older, and not only
when they were babies. We can see, for example, that even though people
appear to have various powers of self influence, we know that
environments and history will influence people in such a way that they
will seem to be harmed even if it appears that they may have certain
powers to control their situations. Viewed in retrospect, alcoholics and
drug abusers often had conditions and physiologies that trended them
towards their life situations, such that we start to think that there
are interchangeabilities of adults with respect to controls. To give
another example, if one is born into an aboriginal family in poverty,
and becomes an alcoholic later, one might observe, that a baby put into
an aboriginal family in poverty, from elsewhere, would likely have
similar conditions and potentially may also be alcoholic later. This
means there are interchangeabilities in the babies, but also
interchangabilities in the adults relating to those other
interchangeabilities of babies. Adoption studies seem to confirm that
babies will make people like others in their environments as adults and
not only as babies, in that if a person from one culture is moved to
another, they will resemble people in that culture later, even as
adults, and not only as children.<sup><a href="14">14.</a></sup></p>
<ul>
<li>All humans, had negligible influence, that cause us to want to say
zero influence, at conception up to the time of birth, regarding their
physiology, including growth instructions within physiology, that would
control growth and composition later in life, including traits of brain
size, and various properties of the brain that are not under influence
of decisions by the brain.</li>
</ul>
<p>These specific measures, used for all people, imply that there are
some equalities of interest that are very narrow, but universal among
human animals. In this discussion, it is important to notice these
equalities are specific to what is measured, and not what has not been
measured. An additional proposition may be added:</p>
<ul>
<li>None of the properties of babies themselves, or resulting people,
along their life cycles, have been yet measured.</li>
<li>No other measurements have been taken regarding the properties of
the people themselves, including millions and billions of physical
properties about their compositions.</li>
</ul>
<p>From this we can infer (and we could use formal logic to do so, but
here will proceed informally):</p>
<ul>
<li>We have not aggregated individual measurements sufficient to
consider equality of babies as complex objects.</li>
</ul>
<p>This simply means we have insufficient measures to make an inference
about babies compared in total, or people compared in total along their
life cycles. However, we this does not mean we do not have something
important. Namely, we have found that people seem to have zero power to
control their own compositions, including brain compositions and growth
instructions, before birth (we can’t influence earlier in timelater,
and, nearly zero influence during development in utero.</p>
<p>If we were each measured on our abilities to control our initial
creation, it would be that we have no control at all. We would all be
measured to be powerless on our origin stories. We cannot influence how
our parents met and who are parents would be, and where they would be on
Earth. This does not mean that we are equal on all measures, but just
that very important measure. That very important measure is one that is
truthful and honest, and applies to everyone, and has great implications
for our lives, and for who is really deserving of what, since it appears
people can deserve very little, that harms or benefits them.</p>
<p>Democratic nations have utilized a more vague version of this more
accurate and detailed fact, that we were all babies with measurably zero
influence about our composition early at life, and our early life
situations, to incorrectly further infer that we are totally equal in
value. In historical documents, like the Declaration of Independence, we
see “…we were all created equal…” which appears close to what we accept
as true above. When many of us reflect on this idea, that we were all
babies initially, powerless to define our physiological compositions,
and who we are, and where we were, and what time we were born, and
period of hisotry, we come to want to alleviate some problems in some
lives that were especially difficult. Since none conrolled the starting
point, and many suffered because of their starts, we think things like
“what if my start was as difficult as theirs?” There can be no merit or
demerit in any starts that anyone had because we did not control the
events. People do not deserve to be harmed, we think, if they had no
control at all. Likewise, we see that we did not deserve to have special
benefits, if we did not have any measurable control of our situations.
However, we know the reality is that situations and initial conditions,
including initial physiological compositions and growth instructions,
really do result in either really good benefits, or some serious
detriments, or in many situations, basic or mundane conditions. Some
will starve, some will be fed, and some will live in opulent luxury, and
all without any control over initial conditions and many important
conditions which determine later conditions (physiological composition
and physiological growth instructions).</p>
<p>and measurably and equally had no control over our initial starts, an
inaccurate view, very vague, that we somehow each of us are totally
equal, on all measures. We have started to talk of equalities without
doing any comparisons at all, and have started to think that mature
adults are equal irrespective of traits and resulting outcomes.
Simplicity of expression in marketing, saying things like “Human
equality” without stating what that equality is about, has resulted in
various successful projects for expanding welfare. There were side
effects to this simplicity of thinking and marketing, and of growing
from a germ idea that was true, to other ideas that were untrue.</p>
<p>Marketing and advertising, including catchy slogans, and attractive
short messages that are easy to remember, are vital for spreading social
and political projects. Nowadays, if we want to spread a social message,
we might convey it briefly using social networks, including some that
only allow a very small number of characters to say things (one requires
255 characters or less). In capitalistic countries, advertising is a
form of entertainment, and punchy, provocative, and fun expressions are
more likely to create successful efforts. Methods of advertising trace
back to propaganda, and other early methods of gaining attention and
sales, through the history of our nations, back to early times. It
relates to persuasion with limited time and attention of an audience. It
relates to creating attention quickly where there isn’t any. In order to
convince others that a movement of Equality is needed, and that
equalitarian culture is desirable, marketing methods are necessary. This
means we can anticipate consequences to these methods of marketing.
Primarily, they are short and unclear, and do not rely on rationality
and good quality of logical thinking to convince. Instead, what is
mostly desired is that people will attend, hear the message, and
remember it. They hope that it will influence minds and perhaps result
in gossip, and conversation. If marketing results in conversation it is
often very successful, because not only was a message attended to, more
were created. Equality and equalitarian culture were slowly popularized
using short messages, in news, and other sources of messages. News is a
form of advertisement although that is not readily recognized. Short
headlines and short news messages convey quickly in a similar
methodology to plain advertisements, which also are found in news
sources. News influences what gets advertised, and it is hoped that what
gets advertised becomes real news. Any way to copy messages to create
more is important in the toolkit of the message spreader, whatever their
medium happens to be. What is important to convey here, is that the
Equality project<sup><a href="7">7</a></sup> has been in the news, has
been advocated by politicians briefly using propaganda, marketing and
advertising techniques, and so on, and has utilized short messages, that
were intended above other considerations to be persuasive, and result in
proliferation of new messages by others for free. The goal is to use
less effort to get others to repeat messages. If everyone is talking
about Equality and the benefits of equalitarian culture, then success is
more likely. If no one is talking about it, then even if the initial
messages were costly, and rational, then there is likely not going to be
success. It means minds have not been thinking about it.</p>
<p>The Equality movement<sup><a href="7">7</a></sup> in our history has
been detrimented by the methods of marketing it has relied upon for its
own success. This means that its tools that it needed to become a
success has aresulted in side effects that are not beneficial. This was
likely known to some original figures important for early spread. People
tend to like to use true statements to persuade and not merely
persuasive statements. However, companies and politicians know they have
to be catchy and inevitably utilize what will be persuasive for ensuring
their success, because their efforts are costly. This means it is known
there will be side effects to the same work that results in progress.
Some may use the phrase “collateral damage” to explain this kind of
phenomena. If I want an Equality movement to succeed, because I know it
means some people will be living much better lives, I will be willing,
perhaps, to sacrifice that some persuasion was not due to rational
thinking, or that short messages may result in less detailed worldviews.
My main mission is to make people feel better, perhaps for the very long
distant future, and for now, I’m willing to persuade with messages, that
I am not entirely satisfied with, because of how short those messages
are, or what happens to be catchy to the audience.</p>
<p>There have been many side effects to these efforts which resulted in
a style of thinking that is too simplistic. This style of simplistic
thinking, having a long history, is now traditional, and certain old
pieces of propaganda still surface during holdiays, or voting events, or
times when people are narrowly thinking about what has been beneficial
in equalitarian culture. While thinking about civil rights movements, I
will be less in thought about competition, and more about shared
welfare, and objectives about making sure people have their basic needs
addressed. Instead people are in a celbratory mode of thinking. The
marketing and propaganda, and way of popularizing a larger equality has
resulted in a lack of clarity of what is really true in human
similarities and differences, and unfortunately because this was a
method of popularization with slogans, it truly became popular. What is
popular is the simplicity and vagueness of expression, but not the
clarity on the key facts which are useful to making welfare something we
can improve on. Development on this idea requires increasing precision,
and by getting our details right, we will have a better chance of a more
mature and developed social justice and distribution of welfare that was
closer to the intentions of people who were focusing on “tabula rasa”
and a morality taking our origins as babies unable to influence our own
being as an important fact.</p>

Correct Usage of Equality, Remembering Mathematics</a></h2>

<p>The word “equality” is not one that is right in all usages, and
arguably it is not easy to use correctly, unless in very simplistic
matters. A regular person can create simple equations, saying perhaps
that 3 times 4 is equal to 12. But when it is very complex, they will
not be able to tell whether two formulas are equal or not. This implies
that everything that is not simple is something in which equality may be
unknown, when comparing two things.</p>
<p>Switching to the political context, one would not expect more
precision, and a greater ability to find equalities, than if one is in a
scientific context. Politicians are not mathematicians. That someone
utilizes it in a political context, does not indicate that their usage
is correct, or immune from criticism. Somehow, people forget that
equalities are not easy to confirm, from their struggles in math class.
Instead, they switch to a political context, and believe quickly that
various Equalities exist, without doing any math. Being
non-mathematical, this kind of usage is especially <em>open</em> to
criticism, not closed. In math, work is frequently criticized until it
is really believed that equations are correct and reflect equalities,
and not mistakes. If one does not get an equation correct in math, one
gets it <em>wrong</em>, or <em>completely wrong</em>, in a school
context. Teachers may not give any credit at all for an incorrect
answer, indicating that an equality exists when it is really <em>not
equal</em>.</p>
<p><em>Just learning in mathematics, we made mistakes, and the best
mathematicians are making mistakes until they finally get their work
right; implying, that one must know how to get it right even in the
social-political sphere, in order to confirm Equality in an particular
argument.</em> Politicians and lay-people would not be better at finding
precision, and would not be more immune from utilizing the word
incorrectly than mathematicians. Instead, they would be <em>more</em>
likely to get it wrong, perhaps not really understanding what the word
means, or by using it in a traditional way that is defective due to how
it was introduced and practiced in daily experience. The trust we have
in equality is not from anyone in the public, other than mathematicians
who have found ways to use it correctly!</p>
<p>Equality is a tool that is used. If it is not used like a tool there
is an indication it isn’t being used at all. It has rules of utility. We
can recall rules of mathematics that allows us to make changes to
equations while preserving equal comparisons. We did not at any time not
use it as a tool to indicate values or formulas on one side and the
other aren’t identical. In the political sphere, there have not been
rules set up for usage, and transformations, and comparisons, the same
way that it has been done in mathematics. Again, this is because it is
not mathematical, and instead has borrowed the word from math to create
credibility, to futher a political movement.</p>
<p><em>Mathematicians provide us with good examples of the utilization
of equality, which can assist us in knowing when it has not been used
well, but instead resembles Equality.</em> When intelligent
mathematicians have employed equality well, it was in the comparison of
values which were the results of precise measurements, or in the
comparison of numbers. We can recall in math making equalities like 2n =
8, where n is 4, or in phyics, 3cm*n = 9cm, where n is 3. The
mathematical trust and precision that we have given to the word is for
it implies that there has been an evaluation anytime it is used, which
is a valuation in numbers, or a valuation in numbers with concrete
measurements, or a combination of the two. When one first takes Physics,
one learns that there is a difference between their studies on math, and
science, in that math often omits the use of measurements entirely,
whereas, it is of paramount importance in science that measurements are
used. It is somewhat tricky to learn how measurements are to be
manipulated in conjunction with numbers.</p>
<p><em>Good examples of the usage of equality require that values are
available for making comparisons, to confirm equality.</em> Mathematics
and science both expect that there is an evaluation which results in a
comparison of equality. It is not possible to write an equality formula
without their being an evaluation. We always expect that there is a
number on one side, or forumula which includes expressions involving
numbers, that will be identical, equivalent, or equal to what is on the
other. Anything placed on one side of an equation already has a value
related expression. Both in science, and in mathematics, the reader is
trained to do this, from school, and would not object to this idea, that
equality expects a comparison of values. One cannot truthfully write an
equals sign, an “=” between two numbers, or mathematical formulae, or
expression, unless the values that are involved are equal to each other.
One cannot put an equal sign until one has recognized that values really
are equal. Otherwise the symbols used would be what we know as
inequalities and not equalities. We have the symbols for greater than
“&gt;”, or less than “&lt;”, to denote when valuations are different on
each side. If it is conditional on formula reduction or evaluation, we
use greater-than-or-equal-to “&gt;=” and less-than-or-equal-to “&lt;=”.
In programming, we have unequal, which is “!=”. If an equality is
written down on paper, and what is on the left side is not the same
value as what is on the right side, we have written it incorrectly. What
would correct it would be to write “!=” not equal to, instead of “=” for
equal to. These symbols are not used when values have not been compared.
If there are no values, then one has left math using equality, and has
proceeded to do something else. You don’t use equality when a
measurement has not happened or is not expected to happen, or if you
don’t have a number or formula that results in values on one side, and
the other<sup><a href="#6">6</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Let’s start looking at some examples, beginning with an empty
equality comparison, with blanks that would be filled in with values,
measurements, for formulae which can be evaluated using various inputs.
Our examples will primarily be simple ones to make sure there is good
clarity. The findings from these simple examples also apply to those
that are increasingly complicated, so we do not need to provide really
complex examples.</p>
<p>__________ = __________</p>
<p>Looking at simple math in which we are all familiar, we can see
something is expected on the left, and on the right, and those things
would often be plain numbers, which would come from measurements in the
world, which are compared. Now let’s make the example real, thinking
about what we might really want to compare from everyday experience.
Using sports again, let’s compare two athletes on traits they might
have. This is something routinely done in boxing, to compare athletes
who are supposedly of similar enough characteristics to have what might
be called a “fair fight”. Let’s say we have one athlete who is 165
centimeters tall, and the other is 166 centimeters tall. Now we have two
values that allow for a real comparison, which then permits us to ask
whether there is equality or not. Filling out the above equality with
the values, we have:</p>
<p>165 = 166</p>
<p>But this is incorrect, and in school we would be corrected by our
math instructor who would tell us that 165 is not equal to 166. Instead,
we would have to rewrite this in order to get it right, as an
<em>inequality</em>:</p>
<p>165 != 166</p>
<p>This would be correct. Notice that for any value that is not 166, if
we filled that value in on the left hand side, it would be unequal also.
Only for 166 would it be equal. This means that it would very seldom be
an equality that is found when comparing heights with any specific
individual. For someone who is 166cm tall, they are only equal in height
with another who has 166cm in height. For all other comparisons it would
be unequal, and therefore we expect and anticipate inequality and not
equality.</p>
<p>But if each athlete were measured to be 166 centimeters tall, then
our equation below would be correct:</p>
<p>166 = 166</p>
<p>What we have done above is something required if we want to inherit
the authority and trust created by mathematics in claiming that two
things are equal to one another. If we really make comparisons between
values and measurements, and we find them to be really equal, we can
really place an equality between them, and say they are mathematically
equal, at some level of precision. Here that level of precision is
centimeters. By doing it right, we are getting much closer to being able
to say that things are equal, and doing it this way, we can build up
comparisons between objects to see just how equal or unequal they are,
in a way that a scientist would do it. Later we will see, that doing
this type of comparison results in better quality comparisons of complex
objects, including athletes, and people, which allow us to decide how to
provide social justice and distribution of rewards and resoruces. Doing
it this way, instead of assuming people are equal in total, without
noticing differences or doing any math, we will feel more honest. Again,
usually when things are compared this way, inequalities are found and
not equalities. But these inequalities, like inequality in height,
indicates that we have diversity in heights. Presently in equalitarian
cultures diversity is much celebrated, particularly in athletics, with
the result there is confusion about Equality, because when we compare
for real we keep seeing and finding inequalities instead.</p>
<p>Talking more mathematically and scientifically, we might say that
there are two objects in the world, two people, who are athletes, who
are equal in height at the time of this measurement, to a measure of one
centimeter. That is an example of a rough equality which is clear and
really does exist to our satisfaction in nature, between two athletes.
There is no need to talk about some vague social Equality on this point.
We really can rely on mathematical equality which itself has that trust
which we really can borrow from a long history of math, the discipline
which itself depends on it, as self-evident. Outside of math, in a vague
social territory, where much argumentation and disagreement is expected,
it is not self evident, that Equality exists. It is only when we are
doing something such as this, that we are permitted to say such a thing.
Otherwise, we really are tainting math, and are pretending to have the
rigor, and discipline, and clarity, that only math has.</p>
<p>Above it was mentioned that we can build up to see how more complex
objects compare in a scientific way, and focusing on athletes, we notice
that this is what we really do in sports. In boxing we need more
information than height to see if two athletes are compatible enough to
have a contest. We could not on height alone infer that these two
athletes are compatible, and if we did not measure more, sports
enthusiasts would complain that there is unfairness in the fight.
Typically we’ll also measure athletes on weight as well. Suppose we
measure the athletes on weight, and find that they are both 68
kilograms. We can say on that they are roughly equal regarding weight
too, to a precision of 68 kilograms. Using these two metrics we can
begin to make a table similar to those that show how athletes compare
before a fight.</p>
<p><em>There are rules in mathematics concerning what is irrefutable,
self-evident, proven, or axiomatic, and these rules do not carry over
into social and political discussions, they way they are presently
conducted.</em> Notice outside of math, and science, and chemistry, and
physics, we are not really permitted to say things are self-evident, in
the same way as has been attempted in historical political documents.
You can’t be a witness to something and claim it is self-evident.
Rather, you may have witness evidence that something has happened.
Likewise, you cannot look at two people, and simply exclaim that it is
self-evident somehow, that they are equal in value. You certainly cannot
claim it is self-evident, that any two people who are compared are equal
to each other. At most you can produce evidence that the equalities
exist. Self-evidence and irrefutability relats to extremely precise work
being done or has been done that is mathematical, or scientific, and not
political. There are some exceptions, like in mutual perceptions of
events, in with two people perceiving the same thing, can mutually admit
as a datum, that that thing was perceived or happened, without
interpretation. For example, “My friend and I both saw a tornado, and
also videotaped it. Between the two of us, it is evident we saw a
tornado.” Something similar to this relates to confirmation of
measurements. Above the two athletes were said to each have a height of
166cm. More than one measurer mutually confirm that it was true that
these were the measurements. Between the two of them, if they each
really did measure it correctly, it appears evident the measure is 166
(between them, but others would need additional confirmation
potentially). However, for now let us not focus on this. Trust that the
author really did consider this and many other factors in the arriving
of the conclusion that we really do need to rely on the more
mathematical style of thinking separate from the vague Equality style of
thinking, and this will be more clear as we make our way through this
article. This article will get technical.</p>
<p>Here are our first two values which will start our table comparing
the athletes, on different relevant measures:</p>
<p>68 kilograms weight 166 centimeters height</p>
<p><em>Here we will complete our table comparing these athletes with
details that are common for comparing boxers.</em> We will also compare
their “reach”, which related to how long their arms are. Let us also add
their body fat percentages, and lean mass. For these values I’m simply
coming up with numbers. Using these values we will find impossible
metrics potentially (combined with weight and height). Let’s say they
are all found equal:</p>
<p>68 kilograms weight = 68 68 kilograms weight 166 centimeters height =
166 centimeters height 170 centimeters reach = 170 centimeters reach 12
percent body fat = 12 percent body fat 60 percent lean mass - 60 percent
lean mass</p>
<p><em>As we add values to our table we get a better view of relevant
details of these two people, which allows us to better estimate their
compatibility to have a fair fight; and for the purposes of the present
article, what should be evident to the reader is that only by doing this
can we begin to see how simmilar or dissimilar two complex objects might
be, including people.</em> At this point, if these two athletes are
still having the same measurements for each measure, would have very
similar traits if viewed visually. This would mean one could expect that
if they were both seen, they would have many visual things in common
versus if hey were compared with others. This would mostly be concerning
their dimensions, and if we think about it we are measuring spatial
aspects. If we were to draw pictures of each person using only
geometrical figures like an artist might, when beginning a sketch, those
figures might look much alike, compared with if the same were done for
others. What this implies is that their aggregate measures are beginning
to come to a comparison of complex objects that are starting to seem
more spatially equal. They are approaching more total equality, as one
moves from a single measure to what could later be a huge number of
measurements.</p>
<p><em>We really do not think that as we add values to this table that
we would repeatedly find equalities like this, even at low precisions
for each measure; by this the reader should notice that adding more
measures to compare complex objects we increasingly expect to find
differences on some measures, and certainly don’t expect them to be
equal on all measures.</em> A reader might find it annoying or
irritating that even five measures were provided in the example showing
equality. But why would that be? The reason for that is that in the real
world taking two complex objects for comparison, like people, who are
different and diverse, even if similar, we would immediately notice
differences, and we know that if we measured these differences,
inequalities would be found for those metrics. Looking above, it is
clear that these two athletes wouldn’t really exist for comparison, or
it would be really rare, even for just these five measures. We would
even start to disbelieve reports if they showed too much similary,
because we know in practice such similarities for even a few measures is
unlikely, even if we are comparing things we expect to be similar
already, or compatible, like these two boxers. Boxers wouldn’t be
compared if they were not already seen to be similar by people who can
quickly make visual comparisons.</p>
<p><em>We tend to disbelieve that equality exists even on single
measures, however, and this is because at high precision, we know we
will typically find inequalities.</em><sup><a href="#8">8</a></sup> The
very first measure on height was already not believable; and this is
because of two reasons With these simple measures, we are still
concealing details that would reveal differences between these athletes,
because so far we have only used low precision numbers, which make it
appear like the athletes are more similar than they really are; by this
what the author should notice is that we are only stating as a
convenience that these athletes are equal, to a level of precision,
knowing that if we compare more exactly, we suspect we will find small
differences. This suspicion about the unreality of finding them
equality, for me, was earlier though. It was at the very first
measurement. If I am prepared to hear about the measurements of height
of two different people, I am instantly ready to hear different values.
Two people, who are close in height, who are boxers, really might get
the same value, but that still doesn’t resolve my concern, because my
expectation is that if they are measured <em>more precisely</em> than
centimeters and inches, a difference would be found. What this means
is</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>On just one common measure at a high level of precision the
expectation is that people are unequal and not equal.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This brings us to an important finding that we will assume for the
remainder of this article, and it is that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>No two people are equal in total, and we expect this, even if we
are measuring only one thing, and if we go one measure at a time, we
expect them to be unequal on all things.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Measuring any two people on any measure at high precision we
would not anticipate that they would have an equal result.</em> When we
do find an equality, it is because, we have not measured precisely. We
have found a rough equality, which has permitted us to ignore
differences which still existed in the precision.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="no-indent">
That doesn’t mean we weren’t doing a good job measuring, especially if
one compares with not measuring. We also saw, that if we kept measuring,
we get to a picture of what the person really is. If we measured all the
traits of the one athlete, and the other, and drew out both people, we
would have pictures of what both people really look like. But, it would
not be perfect. We would have created what is like a video game likeness
for the athletes, and not the athletes.
</div>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Two people therefore can be roughly equal on measures for
specific traits, but not in total, but more precisely, not at all,
excepting for very specific scenarios, which really are not related, but
will be considered later in this article.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Vague Equality is wanting to ignore variations in people to claim
that they are Equal, but it was found that they cannot be mathematically
equal even on one measure, and certainly not when all of them are
totaled together. This means that Equality is to be greatly distrusted,
once gain, because it borrows a mathematical concept that would provide
precise results that opposes a political agenda, Equality. The opposing
viewpoint is the one that creates clarity, and not vague Equality.</p>
<p>Since we suspect that on a single measure of a single trait, that we
would not find equality at high precision, and since visual comparisons
of people have created expectations that for any two people compared,
differences will be seen, that will result in different metrics, when
measured, we have the proposition<sup><a href="#9">9</a></sup>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Inequality is self-evident</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have said earlier that equality is a rare area in math, where there
is an exclusive ability to say things are self-evident. If you compare
two heights, and each are 66 cm, then when you put 66 on both sides of
the equation, it is found to be true. In math without measurements it is
taken to be self evident, instant knowledge, that if 66 is on one side,
and 66 is on the other, there is an identity, or a true equality. Seeing
both on each side, one does not fight at all against it. All
mathematicians agree that</p>
<p>66 = 66</p>
<p>Likewise, if you do a good rough measure two athletes, and they
are</p>
<p>66 cm = 66 cm</p>
<p>Two physicist-mathematicians would agree they are equal height, to a
precision of 66cm.</p>
<p>However, physicists would agree, that measuring with more precision,
for almost any measure, would for each measure, result in an inequality.
These two athletes, measured more closely, would be each perhaps:</p>
<p>66.047 cm != 66.214 cm</p>
<p>Which means that the physicist-mathematician, or just mathematician,
and really anyone who thinks about it, would know in advance, that two
people are going to be unequal on height. I am tempted to conclude that
this point is self-evident, however, it really is confirmed in the data.
We happen to have histories of knowledge that makes us really expect, on
statistical grounds which are natural in our minds, that if we compare
two people who are close in height, they will be unequal. You don’t want
to fight me on this conclusion, and you really do think that would be
the outcome.</p>
<p>Now, that was for one measure. Consider that for a highly complex
object like an athlete we use many measures. On all measures we expect
the same situation, even just for sporting measurements, that are normal
for athletes to get measured on. If we get really good at measuring
athletes, we have hundreds of measures. But if we go into biology, and
medicine, we have millions. This is why I have concluded above that
inequality is self-evident. You will not fight me regarding this because
you agree. But better for us both:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Inequality is self-evident implies Diversity in total is
self-evident.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This means that we expect uniqueness for every person. So while we
have this vague idea of Equality, capitalized, which we are finding
doesn’t quite make sense, we do have what seems to be on the same side
as that idea we were wanting to retain, Diversity. Diversity really
appears to be a clear concept, that does <em>not</em> have the defects
of vagueness of Equality capitalized. It depends also on the automatic
perception of inequality which makes it really obvious. Both concepts
depend, on our proof of their existence, which supports the obviousness
of them both, of mathematical measures which utilize comparisons using
equality. We just find again and again that things are not actually
equal when measured in precision. Look around any room with people in
it, and you already know this though.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>It appears unreasonable to fight complaints against Equality as a
social norm</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is why this article seemed necessary for me to write, but also
spend extra time considering. I know that if I go against a social norm
like Equality that I’m going to have people want to dispute me. However,
I also know, that going the other long path at explanation, going in the
details, that people <em>would not</em> want to dispute me. Awkwardly
though, they are left in contradiction, if I don’t do more work to make
them feel comfortable, that they really were aright to want social
betterment, while they were not correct in persisting in joining
everyone on vague Equality. Notice that even if the reader agrees, they
would face also the issue I face, of trying to explain and articulate
that to others. This was my issue finally completing this paper:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“How am I going to tell people that Equality is unreal but
they’ll get what they were wanting be accepting Inequality is
self-evident.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Saying inequality is self-evident feels similar to calling everyone
in my culture a liar, or at least, very confused. I think it is the case
that all were confused due to the way that our nations taught us topics
relating to democratic ideals, which have characteristics of marketing
and propaganda. Going with “Equality” as a slogan did have force too,
which indicates it has potential as a tool of propaganda and marketing.
However, it has terribly confused itself for a mathematical worldview;
in reality, it doesn’t compare anything doesn’t take measurements.</p>
<p>I think the cause of this related to our wanting to overlook that
people are different in wanting to allocate care and concern for
well-being. Both the reader, and myself, would persist in thinking
“regardless of what the person’s traits are, we want the to have minimum
care and freedom from cruelty.” The details of what the fairness
consists of here is something people greatly disagree on. But going into
the details the way we are now doing it, will get us to a better idea of
clarity about how to allocate resources amidst inequalities. Remember,
in sports, people are not expecting to pay all athletes the same way.
But almost everyone would be confused to explain why.</p>
<p>This is because where there is competition, and merits and
excellences, and weaknesses and unexcellences, people expect to be
rewarded differently. This means we really want inequalities in
treatment relating to inequalities in people. Someone who is doing well
frequently, might get an unequal amount of praise. But we do think that
is fitting too.</p>
<p>But what does that mean about making sure people are cared for at a
minimum amount, or at an amount we find pleasing, regardless of
differences. Is that what fairness and justice are? To be clear, this is
emphatically <em>not</em> what equality is, and notice we haven’t
measured anything. This is an area where I anticipated a reader may
think like I do, and state that this is the equal treatment that was had
in mind. But this is due to vagueness and lack of detail, and the reason
is because a system that strives at this has to account for
interpersonal differences, regional differences, and the like, in trying
to give what seems like it might be fair. Consider human resources tries
to pay people for the same work in different markets a rate fair for
that market, without thinking about the person. This seems fair because
it is doing it regardless of the person, but it is unable to do it well
regarding the markets, and should take into consideration personal
preferences. This is what happens when a worker applies for a job, and
gets it in one market that is not the other, and is expected, to have
preferences that align with the region. The distribution of care and
concern at a basic level is also undefined, which means that what is
given in one region can never be measured equal to another region, even
if in each region those calculations correspond to a separate measure
which corresponds to the basic measure.</p>
<p>Here is where I want the reader to be cautious. There is a strong
desire for people to say “That’s the equality I was talking about,
therefore no more thinking is needed.” But that is entirely incorrect.
It ignores that many confusions about different meanings of the vague
Equality were combined, and did include for some, this one. That doesn’t
save the errors. Furthermore, it doesn’t protect it against our
alternative strategy, which really does lead to clarity. Suppose we gave
everyone a dollar value of money equal per capita, even if that amount
sent out was equal, it turns out that it doesn’t actually result in
Equality that is social justice and fairness, and in measure isn’t equal
either, in the precision (i.e. Families with children versus single
households was not considered, which means even choice is ignored).
Everything outside of this fund of money which does send out checks with
the same value written on them, is inequality and competition-like.
That’s everything in our natural world we live in, except the check! And
the result would not be what people would want. Because what people want
is clarity on what the situation is, and <em>unequal</em> distribution
of goods to achieve more balanced well-being, and not equal
distribution.</p>
<h3
id="categories-like-humanity-and-equality"><a name="categories-like-humanity-and-equality">Categories
Like ‘Humanity’ and Equality</a></h3>
<p>Using humanity to select any two organisms at random, one would not
end up with two people, who are anywhere near what we would have
considered equal, using our measures in sports. This would be a way to
have two people who are the most dissimilar people and not the most
similar. Meaning, maximally different organisms on earth, that can mate,
are taken to be equal. But that’s the same thing as saying two people
who are the most different are the same, on the basis of belonging to
the same category.</p>
<p>This paper is nearly complete, but there is one error which again
comes up which must be considered, so that readers will be able to
adjust in ordinary life to changes that are implied. One will either
make this error about to be discussed, and have to self-correct over
time, or else notice other people making the error, and having to
tolerate it or help them realize the changes that need to be made.</p>
<p>This is thinking that a particular word, which seems to apply to
everyone, or categorize everyone, makes them “the same”, and therefore
is the source of equality. The example I think that most definitely will
take time to eradicate, is of thinking that because people are human,
they are all equal. That they are all members of the same species, means
they are all the same.</p>
<p>Notice based on the preceding conversation, that one has to overlook
all the diversity, all the differences in measure, all the things we
think makes one having strengths which should be rewarded, to get
somewhat foggy, thinking there is some property we can see that is
‘being a human’ which makes everyone the same. Consider that you cannot
see this trait either. You can more or less point out similarities, but
you will struggle to draw out a blueprint of what a human is, working
alone, trying to determine what is really similar between everyone.</p>
<p>Fortunately for us though, the term human is already a scientific
one. The term human does not imply equality even in science, but a
compatibility of sorts. A sexual interchangeability is part of what has
been used to define what a human is. This definition appears somewhat
related to what is used also, of overlapping genetic similarity. One
person is said to be more than 99% similar in DNA code to another, but
still not quite equal. Trying to define human by pointing out specific
DNA is not possible, which also indicates that DNA variation exists
across all humans, and that there is no fundamental blueprint which is
common to all humans and their DNA. In other words, there is no set
which would be the center of a Venn diagram, using all DNA sets, which
can then be pointed out as a prototype human.</p>
<p>Species membership is well understood, however. Species membership
really is due to sexual reproduction. One species cannot mate with
another and have a very good expectation of viable offspring, which
means that humans really are separable and classifiably distinct from
other primates. Humans themselves are roughly interchangeable sexually,
although perfect interchangeability has not been confirmed. It is not
clear that there are divergences within human populations which make one
person sexually incompatible with another. Nevertheless, take one person
and mate them with another, one can expect that they will have viable
offspring. For any two people who fall into the set of primates we
vaguely visually distinguish as human, we can rightly call them human,
if they can sexually reproduce. There are many off cases to this, but I
think we will get through the purpose of this conversation without
covering those.</p>
<p>Now take two people at random on earth, let’s say females who are
interchangeable sexually with a male (notice we did not consider
equality between sexes at all. Being human does not appear enough to
make a male human equal to a female, although we already recognized in
the earlier conversation, that we wouldn’t expect equality anyway). Now
we have, say, two women, who are both definitely of the class and
category “human”. What about putting them in the same class, makes them
totally equal? That is the issue, that some will persist in saying that
one can ignore all traits, and simply say that if we have two humans,
they are equal to one another. Well, we have two confirmed humans, both
women, potentially from very different places on earth, and having a
million features dissimilar. We consider these people as expressing
diversity. The male would not consider them interchangeable, although
sexually he could reproduce with either. He already is thinking they are
not the same, and are not equal. But some will persist and think that by
classifying them using the same word, by having a category in which they
both fall, they are totally equal.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>But why not simply give a full description of each person, and
all these details including the sexuality related details, and classify
them as humans, and avoid talking about how they might be
equal?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is where I think the fundamental flaw exists. Categorization is,
just like a specific measurement, a very narrow way of looking at a
complex object. Finding two humans who really are human doesn’t lead us
to want to infer they are identical. Particularly if that categorization
is not about something in total that equates them, but something narrow
like sexuality, and ability to reproduce. A much better way to compare
objects to search for ways they are similar is to simply look at all the
details one can have, and not one detail, or category, even if that
category also has implications about various similarities that can be
expected.</p>
<p>If you were to take two people by their DNA and draw them up, would
you anticipate, that what you would draw up, would be two of the same
people? Definitely not, because the expectation is that there would be
diverse results of reproduction, and that drawing up a person is
somewhat like, their natural growth from their DNA.</p>
<p>Now let’s say you took the complete description of one person, and
all their measurements, and their DNA, and anything else you have, and
you draw them up. Would you expect, that if they have the very precisely
similar measurements, similar DNA, similar data, etc.. and draw them up,
which is like growing them, that they would be the same.</p>
<p>Well, in this case, you would have identical twins.</p>
<p>But notice people take humanity to be that category that would make
people equal to each other somehow on category alone, without any other
details.</p>
<p>Hearing that someone is a human has some implications as to
expectations about appearance, but these vary greatly.</p>
<p>The thing which results in the better estimation as to what a person
would appear like, and be, would be the complete description, with all
the measurements and DNA, and not the category of human, which would
lead one to have only a very rough idea of what a person would.</p>
<h2
id="are-there-truly-equal-things"><a name="are-there-truly-equal-things">Are
There Truly Equal Things?</a></h2>
<p>Moving towards a greater precision in understanding the entire topic,
including all of nature with humans within it, let’s take some time to
talk about what really can be equal. Earlier we arrived at the
proposition that inequality is largely self-evident, while equality is
not. Equality is more difficult to demonstrate, and one expects that on
precise examination, inequality will be discovered instead.
Nevertheless, here are things which appear to seem more likely
candidates for truly equal things, and an example was given above
regarding checks from the government with the same numbers or amounts of
money writtenon them (money objects). We will resume this example to
show how and why money instruments are still unequal, but before
returning to that topic, let’s first consider other real world object
which apparently have true equality comparisons at high precision, or
absolutely. Notice that for the statement</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>These two objects or people are equal in mass.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>means they are equal absolutely, unless one agrees to calling them
equal at a lower precision, which conceals differences which might exist
at a higher precision. This means when we use the word equality in
mathematics, we are really looking for absolute equality. When we use
precision in architecture and construcution, we are looking at rough
equality, not absolute equality in equal building parts and
components.</p>
<p><em>Finding and equality requires work, whereas inequalities require
less.</em> An interesting consideration supporting the current thesis is
that equality is not the simplest thing to find, even if one searches
carefully. Examining the topic more closely one arrives at strange
realizations that things thought to be definitely equal, still are not
on greater consideration.</p>
<p><em>One can safely assume inequalities of comparisons on statistical
grounds.</em> Simple measurements at high precision that still result in
the same values might be said to be approaching equality, but are not
really exactly or absolutely equal. If comparisons of precise
measurements are made over and over again, data is collected indicating
that inequalities are often or always found. Taken frequently enough,
for most things we encounter, the data becomes so uniformly on the side
of inequality, that we become justifiedin expecting and later assuming
inequalities. With enough data it would reveal why it appears
self-evident that inequalities would arise, without taking measurements.
Statistical information can be used to justify assuming nearly
absolutely that inequalities would exist, and therefore:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>We can use statistics to define what we have thought to be
self-evident.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Statistical methods are used in manufacture quality assurance to
determine the expected frequency of defects resulting from inequalities
in parts.</em> Parts have various aspects which can be measured, which
is more apparent when one thinks of engineering diagrams, or technical
drawings, or part specifications, and so on. If any particular dimension
is too different from another on a measure, too unequal, they may no
longer be interchangeable. Interchangeability implies that there are
“close-enough functional equalities”, but this is still a form of
suitable equality, or “congruent inequality”. Congruent inequality could
be taken to mean congruence or concordance of measures despite absolute
inequality, which brings us to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Equality is definable in terms of inequality.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This appears true, but also appears a contradiction, and a paradox,
until one distinguishes what is meant by equality from inequality, which
contains the same word. Put without paradox:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Things which are different on close inspection can be treated as
interchangeable within certain conditions.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These conditions would provide the rules in which people typically
arrive at their inclination to say any two things are equal. This means
we can discard the word equal, or redefine it as an acceptable
similarity arriving in an interchangeability or identity.</p>
<p><em>Interchangeability results from a build up of similarity on all
relevant measurements of an object, related to a functional equivalence,
which simply means those two objects can be used to perform really
similar work, or be utilized to fulfill some really similar goal. A
mathematician, can also, comparing two values, without any units
specified, might be lead to believe, falsely, that an equality exists,
corresponding to the equation. <sup><a href="15">15</a></sup></em> Here
we will use an argument scaling from single measurements of specific
dimensions, to larger objects on an aggregate of measures. Measuring two
things, and finding them to have equal length, at extreme precision, it
might enable mutual interchangeability in manufacture, might be
considered suitably equal. However, such a measure is still imperfect,
and quality control in manufacture would still estimate some likelihood
of failure or defect. On that one measure, going ever more precise, one
would find that they still are not equal down to the elemental level.
Nowadays in manufacture of metal parts, some are creating cuts which are
invisible to the eye, but nevertheless, resulting parts are known to be
unequal. Expressed in an equation, the two values, at that level of
precision, would be considered “good enough equal” to a physicist and
mathematician, but not purely equal.</p>
<p><em>Mathematics is not the same as physics in omission of specific
measurements and units.</em> A physicist would say that certainly these
two things are not equal in an ultimate way, because precision of
measurement can be increased in various ways. Mathematicians, on paper,
can make symbols match, and somehow think purity has been attained, and
true equalities “found”, never looking away from the paper, or never
thinking and only using the hands.<sup><a href="16">16</a></sup> An
example would help. Suppose two computer chips are measured each to be
2.475895732 centimeters in width. Without units, presented to a
mathematician, 2.475895732 = 2.475895732, might lead to an inference
that this is true. However this is not about the objects, but about the
mathematical statement on paper. Certainly, the right is equivalent to
the left, and there is an identity, and these values are the same.
However, there is no corresponding natural thing which has this
equality. We say roughly they are equal, or that they are very precisely
but not ultimately equal, once we are talking about chips, on that
measure with that unit. Perhaps our instrument for measuring that length
does not go to a greater accuracy. Either way the physicist would
immediately assume that still they are not equal.</p>
<p><em>Using this example of a computer chip, we can see how greater
level of similarity is achieved between two complex objects.</em>. Chips
produced in a manufacturing center really are mostly interchangeable,
not only in the width of the chip, but in the total function along
relating to all relevant measures of the chip. Clearly many similarities
would have to be present in order for the chips to be interchangeable,
which means they also look quite complex when you view them. Your view
of them would start to result in increasing inability to notice
differences. As a consumer, you would not see the chip, but you would
experience similarities between models. You buy a computer and it works,
and someone else buys the same model, and it works for them also, very
likely, if they do similar tasks. This means measuring that chip like we
measure athletes, along all the relevant areas of interest for the
business, we find that they are very nearly equal on all areas of
comparison. If we had only those measurements, and we were to draw out
the chip from no other information, we would draw what appears to be the
same chip. The blueprint would be a drawing which would be very similar
in various respects to the drawing we might make without reference to
it. This would indicate in a wide number of ways we have two objects,
which are complex, that are interchangeable, that are approaching what
might be considered absolute equality, or equality, and not “congruent
inequality”.</p>
<p><em>However, again the physicist will say that they still are not
ultimately equal, and we actually really do expect and anticipate the
same.</em> Viewed under powerful microscopes, the edge of one chip would
have strange surface characteristics unlike the other chip. However,
similar differences would exists on many of the other measures which
would relate to the functionality of the device. Working on these chips,
comparing the results of manufacturing, specialists would be utilizing
tools to aid the eye. Looking at chips using such tools, definite
differences would be noticeable. Along with those differences would be
measurable inequalities.</p>
<p><em>Is functional equality something that produces absolute
equality?</em> One might say, there are aspects of the two devices which
are equal in ways that are more resistant to this type of difference
finding. This might be the design of the device which might relate to
paper-based, formal mathematical equivalences. There is more that can be
said about this later, but for now, it will be noted the devices in
total are truly different, and even with really exacting similarities,
there is an expectation that some devices would fail, indicating
industry knowledge about non-equivalence of the chips. Failure is a
definite indication that even functional equality has not been attained.
Although it is to be considered if any two functional pieces produced
are funtionally equal, although the answer to this appears “No”
also.</p>
<p><em>Non-diversity in interchangeability is expected, meaning that
chips should appear non-diverse products on completion.</em> Chips are
complex, but they are highly controlled. Their designs are not intended
to have any diversity. People, however, have considerable diversity.
Comparing people with chips, again, we find that the expectation of
inequality is universal. The expectation of differences that make
diversity possible is universal. Chips are unequal at high precision,
even when they are <em>not diverse</em>! Here we can return to our
primary subject matter briefly, seeing what this might imply about other
complex objects, namely animals, and humans. Humans could never have the
similarity and interchangeability as chips, and since those are unequal
already, even when there is <em>no diversity</em>, we know there can be
no equality in total among humans.</p>
<p><em>When is there no diversity in humans?</em> There is only one type
of non-diversity that applies to humans, and that is identical
twins.<sup><a href="17">17</a></sup> This would be a limited
non-diversity like those of the computer chips resulting from
manufacture. They are copies although the copying process in human
zygotes via meiosis differs from the copying process from blueprint
designs in a factory. In both cases, there are great enough similarities
that we can comment that they are low diversity collections. Cloning is
another example of creation of identical twins, as meiosis of zygotes is
simply natural cloning. If we were able to fill a city with only one
person’s clones, it would be what we think of low diversity. Notice we
already think there is low diversity, if a particular city is not
cosmopolitan, and includes mostly people of the same race and ethnicity
(appearance and behavior). Focusing on the example that currently
exists, of identical twins, we know that there are still differences
between copies, even if it is the lowest diversity example that we have
for humans. From this we can form the proposition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Some diversity exists in any comparison of two humans.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>An implication of this is again, our earlier proposition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Inequality in aggregate is always present for animal complex
objects.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<div "no-indent">A statistical or soundness argument, with an inductively true premise<sup><a href="18">18.</a></sup>, would lead us to:</div>
<blockquote>
<p>“People’s perceptual systems always notice differences and
inequalities for any two animal complex objects when examined
closely.”</p>
</blockquote>
<div "no-indent">Which is a kind of definition of:</div>
<blockquote>
<p>“Inequality is self-evident.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because self-evidence is a conclusion regarding how people react to
observations they make.<sup><a href="#18">18</a></sup></p>
<p><em>Now let’s consider manufactured objects down to an even greater
level of precision to see if we can find an equality</em> If we think of
simpler things that are designed that are manufactured to high
precision, that are interchangeable in function, we find that we have
things that seem really more equal. This is because we’ve reduced the
complexity of the complex objects, so there are less aspects which might
be compared, which would reveal to us noticeable differences. With these
simpler complex objects, though, we still have a similar issue that we
discussed before on single measures. At higher precision we simply
expect to find differences. In manufacture there is a recurring issue
about inequalities that would be found at the elemental level,
particularly for chips that are supposed to be designed to smaller and
smaller scale. If we are comparing two electrical wires that have a
similar purity in the metal, like gold bullion, in a space related
application, where the technology of fabricating the wire comes from a
manufacturing process that already has a 99.99999999999% expectation of
functioning<sup><a href="#19">19</a></sup>, and consistency of
dimensions, we would still find that they do not have the same elemental
configurations. Calculating variety on elemental configurations of gold
in gold wires, or gold lithographs, imprints, and so on, using what a
professional physicist might know, we would still find, I thin, a near
zero probability of equality. Notice this is in an interchangeable part
at maximum purity and consistency, for only one desired element.</p>
<p><em>Now at the elemental level, let’s shift away from the manufacture
of objects, to what nature provides as simple building blocks, including
molecules and atoms.</em> In school we were taught that there is
chemical elemental and molecular interchangeability, with natural rules
provided in chemical and physical equations. Here we have the appearance
of two major efforts relating to two key parts of the conversation
obove: work on identifying what is interchangeable, resulting in a
periodic table and references on molecules, and creation of
transformation rules which are akin to what is found in math, or is
physico-mathematical. Here we are not yet in the domain of the very
smallest building blocks of physical things, as atoms are constituted of
smaller parts, some of which have not yet been identified. It is not
clear when they all would be identified, or if they could be identified.
Nevertheless, we are at a place in our discussion where we are at very
small objects which have been named “atomic” for being perhaps the
smallest which were thought to be interchangeable, building up mostly
everything we see that has mass. We accept or have assumed that one atom
of gold will be the same as another atom of gold. They are extremely
interchangeable, within nature and not only in our designs about how to
utilize it. However, there are still differences that physicists would
notice. Firstly, one molecule of one atom might not have the same number
of electrons. Additionally,they cannot occupy the same position at the
same time. It is not clear that location of an object is truly a
differentiating property of an object. That’s not something I’ll be able
to decide here. But if there are two identical twin people, and they
occupy different space, they can be influenced differently at the same
time, and would have different lifetimes. Similarly, one atom of gold
will have a different lifetime than another atom. Already we assume that
the Earth is composite, made of atoms that had different
historiestracing far back before the its origin: Earth was formed of a
larger of atoms having different life histories (coming from different
events involving sub-atomic particles too).</p>
<p><em>Considering the success of chemistry and physics, that has
depended on assumptions of interchangeability of atoms and molecules,
and the assumptions of transformation rules of molecules, we can see
that we have found something really close to what we originally thought
equality might be.</em> More stable atoms, or subatomic particles, or
other fundamental <em>things</em> in nature, like light photons, might
be even less subject to differences that might be considered lifetime
differences. They might have fewer things that can be different about
them, and have greater interchangeability. I do not know if it is known
that there is anything in nature that cannot be inspected more closely,
however, or does not have spatial differences at any given time. I don’t
know that a Physicist would be willing to claim, that because we have
limitations on measuring and instrumentation, that there is not a very
deep level of structure within seemingly identical things that would
show differences, if they could be shown. If what is to be compared is
not observable, or not each measure of interest is measurable, then it
appears we have another solid proposition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Proposition 9: <em>Equality in nature cannot be confirmed for any two
things compared.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<div>
This strengthens our argument, because now not only have we stated that
absolute equality, or equality, would be rare, such that inequality is
self-evident, we now understand that we cannot confirm any equality. Not
even a single example:
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>Proposition 10: <em>Equality is not detectable in anything</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>There is a disparity between what are mathematics says about
nature and our ability to confirm its predictions, which implies certain
equalites on measures are unverifiable.</em> Considering motion of
objects, which includes any movement of elements composing objects,
there is an assumption of infinitesimal divion. Equations regarding
paths of objects in motion which imply infinitesimal predictions about
objects under comparison, require increasingly difficult verifications
which are impossible for our instrumentation. This means that properties
of objects composing larger objects cannot be confirmed in their
equalities of measures at highest precision. This method of
representation may include commitments to non-confirmation and
non-confirmability of equalities. Again, this would serve to confirm
using another line of argument the above proposition, that equality is
not confirmable in anything, and only using limitations on one measure
that applies universally or nearly univarsally to all objects observed.
Some will say, on this basis, that it appears that nature is following
what can be found on paper very elegantly. For example, perhaps an
object in space is traveling along a curve which is represented very
nicely mathematically, such that, there is some expectation that the
formula used can show more precision than any instrument would verify.
In other words, you can predict its position over and over, and measure
that position, but you can also use the formula, to predict interstitial
positions for which verification with instruments is not possible. Such
a thing might indicate that in the physical-mathematical formulas we can
see equalities which cannot be seen to really exist in nature, but
appear to correspond predictably with nature.</p>
<p>From this, however, is nothing satisfactory to me to confirm that
equality truly does exist in nature, and there are other considerations,
which are in my current interest outside this paper, that I will share
at a later time, that relate to conclusions we might draw here. This is
not something that is confirmed by anyone at present, though. What we
might say about this, is that we are inconclusive as to whether there
are genuine equalities anywhere at all, and that there is no authority
which can claim “yes” or “no” about this at present. I would expect this
to be an area of hot contention, and dispute potentially between
physicists, mathematicians, and chemists, those who blend the discipline
into philosophy, like I do.</p>
<p>Expectations about what equality is in objects of nature is something
that I don’t believe is defined. I think in science the working position
is similar to that in manufacture. We encounter things that behave very
similarly, and in some ways apparently exactly alike, but nevertheless,
are separate. Interchangeability may be what we would use to determine
whether objects are exact. Chemical equations function like other
mathematical equations in the expectations of consistency of results and
utilizes the same symbol, and similar mathematical operations. Specific
elements are entered into manufacturing processes which use chemical
formulas, assuming extreme homogeneity, if approaching perfect
homogeneity in results. The best assembly line, and manufacture, appears
to be of atoms, which are then used very consistently. This type of
thing in nature appears to be where we do find something we can somewhat
agree is equal, even if we have some concerns about the ultimate
precision of that equality.</p>
<p>In my work outside of this paper, I’m inquiring as to the
fundamentals of mathematics in its workings and applications. This means
that a resulting mathematics I would use might not be quite the same as
the mathematics someone else would use, using base<sup>10</sup>
arithmetic and various conventionally accepted operations on numbers.
This might mean that the math I arrive at would not be the same as the
math used by someone else, and yet might have similar results, that are
non-identical. This would imply that even mathematical systems cannot be
considered equal. Yet what I am striving for is one that is more natural
and less arbitrary. So it could turn out that one candidate mathematical
system applied to nature would have a non-arbitrariness, that would
allow us to claim that certain equalities really do exist, which are not
yet identifiable.</p>
<p>This paper does not have a final statement about this topic, but
rater reiterates, that this way of thinking leads to greater precision,
leads to better understanding of complex objects, which in total are
always, at a level of animal complexity, unequal. It confirms that
diversity is also always to be expected, at animal complexity. Diversity
is confirmed by measurements which show equalities we can see often very
easily.</p>
<p>Vague Equality in the social sphere should be abandoned. It combines
too many vague ideas that are not really mathematical in origin, while
trying to pretend self-evidence that is hardly achievable in science or
in math. Self-evidence and precision do exist, but that’s due to gradual
work in the sciences and using measurement and mathematics, which is why
we trust it so much. But we can’t simply claim people are Equal, and
then say that it is self-evident, because we are pretending we are using
math, by using borrowed words.</p>
<p>People are not equal to one another. They are not equal to one
another <em>even if</em> one focuses on really narrow measures we
commonly employ. We do contain chemicals that go down to the elemental
level, that allow for us to function. However, knowing that you contain
carbon does not make you in total equal to me. Lifeless matter contains
carbon. Non-human animals contain carbon. And there is no single
ingredient we can point out, that would lead us to conclude, that on its
basis we are equal. And that is because to do that, we would be
considering a very small part of us, and not us in total. Considering
each person in total, using all of their measurements, we said would
allow us to draw them out, such that we would have something that looks
quite a lot like them. We can only get to that, from all those measures
and all that data. You cannot take any individual piece, and come close
at all to knowing the whole.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><a name="conclusion">Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>In this paper we have arrived at a number of propositions which
appear more trustworthy than others, considering the topic of human
variety and similarity. These appear to be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inequality is expected for any comparison of any two complex animal
objects, including people.</li>
<li>Diversity is expected for any comparison of any two complex animal
objects, including people, excepting only somewhat for identical
twins.</li>
<li>Diversity is the result of differences which are measurably
unequal.</li>
</ul>
<p>These propositions are so trustworthy that there are several
conclusions that we can make that are very reliable:</p>
<ul>
<li>Humans as a rule are unequal.</li>
<li>Humans as a rule exhibit inequality.</li>
<li>Humans as a rule exhibit diversity.</li>
</ul>
<p>We have also seen, that the program of understanding people, with
assumptions about equality are erroneous given these propositions. The
program of understanding people with assumptions about equality like
those discussed is one that results in vagueness, and is a cause of
obstacles to our development and progress for social justice and
fairness. Whereas, a program of understanding people, with details and
measurements, is not incompatible with the above propositions. Instead,
it is compatible with the above propositions. Programs using such an
approach lead to greater clarity, and less vagueness, as they get more
detailed. One should not expect that we are near the terminus of
justice, and being far from this terminus, we should anticipate
increasing detail as we increase our knowledge about it. In traditional
culture, there is a resistance to developing additional details in our
knowledge about it which indicates that equality marketing is partly
interested in increasing or preserving ignorance over increasing
knowledge. The above propositions are not incompatible with increasing
knowledge concerning justice and moving closer to a future terminus on
its application.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>We’ve achieved equality.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The above is not a statement which is about growing knowledge.
Rather, it is decisive at a time when no decision about the topic would
be wise. It also does not indicate what has been compared and what the
values are; so again, it continues the marketing error of using a short
phrase as shorthand, for something people are not clear about.
“Equality” is not a standalone expression for a meaningful comparison or
result of meaningful zoological comparisons.</p>
<p>Imagine if people were to state that Equality between people and
crocodiles existed. You’d wonder what that equality was, if you didn’t
immediately recognize that specific inequalities and diversity would be
more obvious.</p>
<p>It is the position of the author, and a thesis of this paper, that we
ought to abandon the idea of human equality as we have inherited it in
tradition. Keeping it would be akin to continuing and promoting a
program of vague Equality, which is contrary to the above propositions
which really are self-evident, and support diversity. It is better
instead, to speak more about variety and to utilize measurements, if we
really believe ourselves scientific, and to assume the above
propositions, which are antithetical to current and prior assumptions
that people are equal (in the short-sentence format). If the above
propositions are accepted, and they are self-evident so you really do
need to accept them, then the equality movement must also be rejected.
The expectation is this alternative approach will result in clarity in
communication and increased precision in our understanding of our
species, and in deciding what exactly justice is, and how it should be
distributed.</p>
<p>The author and paper support the idea that increasing precision in
measurement results in increasing accuracy concerning objects to be
understood. Refusing to measure, and refusing to notice differences in
measurement, for the purpose of avoiding the conclusion that the above
propositions are true, is really equivalent to avoiding understanding,
and avoiding complexity which exists in the subject of allocating
resources to specific individuals.</p>

<li><a name="4">4.</a> Equality, in the uppercase form, in this article
is the traditional project, and movment, which advocates an undefined
but mutually communicated political and social equality, or social
justice. When one hears about equality on the news, or “equality” in
politics, it is this Equality that is referred to. It is treated
respectfully with expectations of mutual agreement. This Equality is to
be distinguished from mathematical equality, which will be written in
lowercase, without quotation.</li>
<li><a name="5">5.</a> Only when we switch from mathematics to politics
and the social Equality project do these words get confused as being the
same, or get utilized as synonyms for each other. When in mathematics,
these words require very specific meanings in order to be as useful as
they are, and the rules for doing math are different for each of these
concepts. In the Equality project, these words suddenly become
acceptable substitutes, that one uses when one feels one has been used
too repetitively, or when one seems not quite fitting. “Not quite
fitting” however, does not lead to usage that creates a social
expectation that substitution is not permissible, but does lead
sometimes to a usage which is slightly more clear, and closer to
mathematical usage, but still not mathematical. Equivalent may be used
when dissimilarities seem to make it a better word than equal, but may
not be separate from the motive to use it, because the word equal has
been overused in the same conversation.</li>
<li><a name="6">6.</a> Seldom because in math one may still be
interested in modeling forms of social fairness and justice, using
precise mathematical techniques that would not really employ those same
words. Mathematicians may be interested in using mathematical
techniquest to explain what fairness might be in different contexts. In
game theory, there are efforts to describe what fair games might be,
using mathematical methods that use equalities.</li>
<li><a name="7">7.</a> Equalitarian culture is here meant those cultures
that use short non-specific slogans using “equal” in advocacy of social
views concerning distribution of justice and resources. The author has
in mind groups that are often thought to be “western style
democracies”coming from a European, English speaking, or British
heritage. The author is partly from the United States, and is thinking
of the United States, and countries of similar ideals, when he writes
about Equalitarian culture. The reason for using “Equalitarian” and not
“democratic culture” or “western culture” is that currently, both seem
somewhat non-globalist and partial. Equalitarian is also an unfortunate
term to use, yet it does seem to capture the views of groups under
consideration; those who want to advocate a kind of ambiguous equality
that is assumed often in government documents, including the Declaration
of Independence of the United States, but also government documents of
other democratic nations. Equalitarian slogans used typically do not
offer what equality is about, or which comparisons were made, or which
measurements were under consideration, or which social program and
objectives indicate an equal comparison. There is an assumption that
such a comparison would not be required. Statements are short and are
somewhat like “We believe in human equality” or “We are all created
equal” and the like.</li>
<li><a name="5">5.</a> When one has selected a candidate precision of a
simple measurement of an object, that is expected to be somewhat
accurate, it will be found the chosen measure for the task, which is not
too granular, but granular enough for utility, which includes
comparison, will be one that is of low precision, especially taken
relativistically in comparison to how highly precise the measurement
<em>could</em> be. As an example, one may choose centimeters or inches
to measure a person’s height, thinking that usefully precise, and usable
for comparisons. However, immediately one can see that it is low
precision given what is available for measurement of lengths. Even using
low precision of just inches, however, one can see that differences are
anticipated in comparisons, which means what is really expected
routinely at low precision is inequality. If inequality is not expected,
comparisons would not be useful. The choise of measurement and to
measure has some expectation at the precision quickly chosen, which is a
low precision, that differences are detectable and are anticipated.</li>
<li><a name="5">5.</a> I have a strong disinclination to rely on
examples which bring to mind real people. While these may make clear
examples for the reader, I am strongly suspicious concerning the value
of information which has been shared by media, and think that very
likely their situations are not well understood. Furthermore, examples
are easy to arrive at. We can create many examples which would easily
reveal what we know on experience from actual examples which we need not
speak of excessively. Furthermore, I want examples to be more abstract,
to show that they generalize to some if not all other examples which
have existed. In this way the reader is free to call to mind other
examples and see that it applies more generally. My intention is not to
focus only one one example but show how it relates to all the others
also.</li>
<li><a name="6">6.</a> Aggregates of equations may be used to support
the inference that objects are the same. In programming, one may say
that one object that is created under a class is equal to another object
for being created with the same properties. This is more familiar and
two objects may be tested for equality by checking all properties for
their separate equality. Aggregating smaller equalities may be used for
supporting propositions about rough equality of abstract objects or
objects in nature, but more needs to be said about this later in this
article.</li>
<li><a name="7">7.</a><br />
</li>
<li><a name="8">8.</a> Certain measures will have a smaller scale, or
only a few distinct selections. These still have precision related
issues which conceal differences. Some will think, perhaps, that someone
who has blood type A has an equal blood type to someone else who has
blood type A, and so on. Another exmaple might be positive and negative
charges. These examples are of greater interst in our section about what
might be truly equal in world, later in this essay-chapter.</li>
<li><a name="9">9.</a> Propositions are used to provide clarity to
sentences making them more usable in more formal logical arguments. I do
not subscribe to the idea that a propositional expression is one that is
already atomistic regarding its logic and math, and that it cannot be
subdivided further to include additional information completing the
description, which would serve for the best logical and mathematical
arguments possible. Typically, writers do not make the logic very clear.
We can utilize propositions like this to create greater clarity; a
clarity which is appropriate to the type of demonstration to be
provided. What the reader should take from this note is that the author
knows that it can be taken to a more detailed logical view, which the
author knows supports his thesis. It is for this reason that it can be
omitted unless it becomes necessary to show such detail, should it
become more appropriate to do so.</li>
<li><a name="10">10.</a><br />
</li>
<li><a name="11">11.</a></li>
<li><a name="12">12.</a> Deterministic theory is relevant to this
discussion and will be treated elseewhere by the author. Briefly,
deterministic theory points out the importance of physical causes which
precede and exist within and around one’s life, governing one’s life and
future. While this point of view is contented in some ways, it is not
contentended in all ways. It is not hotly contended, for example, that
one’s language and exposure to learning determines one’s mind, and that
without education opportunities, one would not have the mind one has.
Because one is born into a time in which education exists, one has
access to learning that results in one’s mind. This is why we are able
to confidently understand that we think the way we do because of our
surrounding culture, and not like early primordial humans, becasue of
the causal connection with the development of our culture, and the
availability of our learning opportunities. Efforts are expended by
people to learn well, but this does not diminish that if stimulation did
not exist, the brain could not develop.</li>
<li><a name="13">13.</a> The objective of this paper is not to go into
the details of how to measure the power or influence of any person on
their environment or on themselves, and does not deny that as humans
grow, they increase these powers. It is also admitted that the powers
that individuals have on themselves and their environment vary. The size
of the variance appears to be relative to comparisons with other humans
and babies. Compared with other potential forms of power it may seem
quite negligible. Taking a zoological perspective, it is to be admitted
that learning animals advance in measurable ways in their self-influence
and the influence of their environment, but with certain animals it
appears they have negligable gains as compared with humans. It may be
the case that they vary quite greately if the relative comparisons are
made with their own species.</li>
<li><a name="14">14.</a> When two babies from very different genotypes
and phenotypes are placed in the same cultural context, they eventually
become adults that behave similarly, but the similarity is largely due
to the cultural context, which makes it seem as though greater
differences are more obvious and observable at birth, than later, when
the cultural comparisons become more what we are interested in. The
absence of the cultural difference too, is notable, however, which
allows us to attend to baby behaviors, which <em>also</em>, create a
greater appearance of similarity than which exists in the physiology. If
we wanted to understand differences in human physiology, there is an
interest in separating out cultural influences, somewhat to our interest
in understanding animals in their natural contexts versus animals in
zoos. There is much more to be explored on this topic, and the author
believes lingering on this topic would inform the vague nature-nurture
debates which have existed to date.</li>
<li><a name="15">15.</a> This discussion on inequality and equality
applies to the words same and different, and clarifies their usage as
well. We need to have a limitation placed on precision in order to agree
that any two things are “the same” unless we are focusing on one object,
and say it is self-same, or identical to itself. Speaking of people, we
say they have an identity, but only regarding themselves in their
uniqueness. By restricting the word identity to specific individual
people, and not allowing them to be shared, we have already admitted
they are unequal. Again, this may seem an obvious point as we focus on
it in this way, but when Equality arises in conversation in equalitarian
culture, people revert to using vague ideas that people are somehow, or
someplac “equal” to each other. Again and again on close inspection we
find that this is not the case. Likewise, this applies to our usage of
same and different, and explains why people sometimes successfully
communicate regarding sames, and sometimes do not. Absolutely humans are
different and diverse from each other, whereas we admit that when we are
speaking only roughly, there are samenesses that support meaningful
conversation.</li>
<li><a name="16">16.</a> A mathematican, can come to believe, writing
symbols on paper, that those symbols are “found” equal to one another,
even if the mathemacian used the hands only.</li>
<li><a name="17">17.</a> We call them identical twins, not because we
are ready and prepared to provide them the same identity paperworks. We
are not prepared to say they are the same person. Rather, they are the
closest examples among humans to being the same. In math, an exact
sameness is an “identity” or an “equality”. The name identical twins is
a kind of misnomer. They are very similar but they are not really
identical. This is the case even if they are the most similar examples
of comparisons of animals we have available.</li>
<li><a name="18">18.</a> Statistics here would be utilizing data
collected on repeated comparisons of humans in total. Simply using
vision, identical twins side-by-side, would have visible differences
that humans would notice. These differences would be noticed quickly,
and once noticed, would result in a judgement of “self-evidence”. “It is
true just by looking.” On simple reflection of one’s experience, people
know this to be the case, so a definite scientific experiment collecting
such information is not really necessary. For purposes of establishing
the conclusions of this paper, it certainly will not be performed, but
it is expected that any confirming study would arrive at this result.
Our resulting statistical inference on this data and experience would
provide a true inductive input into our premises in our argument for the
theseis of this paper, and for the proposition following this sentence,
realting to this note. For those unexposed to logic, a sound argument is
one that is not only valid logically, but has true premises, which
sometimes require data related evidence and earlier inferences.
Statistics is used to create the true premises and the sound argument.
The complete formalization of this argument is omitted due to excess
complication of the essay in its thesis which is true obviously on
inspection. Again, a completely sound and formalized argument can be
provided indicating the same results. It is not known whether the
present author will have sufficient interest to carry out that effort,
but is able to do so, and if it is performed by another, he would be
grateful for confirmation in the scientific community. This type of
separate work is standard in science either way, where people are not
themselves assured that the work is obviously true in the way the author
does (i.e. does not agree the paper is self-evidently true using their
knowledge and experience).</li>
<li><a name="19">19.</a> In manufacturing, and in other businesses
wanting a very greate level of reliability, and quality assurance, six
standard deviations from the mean might be the maximum allowable level
in which defects may be found. The objective is to have reliablility
approaching 100%, knowing that the reality is that 100% reliability
cannot be attained. Here we see that in manufacture, there is a desire
for extremely consistent product, but an understanding that no matter
how precise, the complex objects will never one be equal to another.
There are enough differences that at least one object will have too many
defects, if the number of objects created is sufficiently large. With a
sufficient number of poducts created, there is a high probability that
one will be a six standard deviation defective product. The size of the
number of products that must be created depends on the type of product
and the statistical distribution.</li>

<p>Below is a list of words of interest realting to the Equality

forgets to use the mathematics as was used in math training, so is
closer to usage in the historical equality movement. This makes sense as
political discussion, and social debate, is often more conversational,
and often does not utilize mathematics even when mathematics is required
for clarity. However, it still borrows words from mathematics, and uses
it in a lax, imprecise way, which is anathema to usage in math and the
science.</p>
