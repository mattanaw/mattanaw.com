Policy/Practice that is Problematic: Excessive Hiring</a></h2>
<p>The current critical issue that our company faces relates to 2017
hiring practices that were good for the larger company’s business, but
in retrospect were not advisable for our division. We increased our
sales team by 129% in just 3 quarters, in an attempt to reach new
company-wide targets, but we did it without clear market justification
for our niche. Additionally, as we know, each of our sales teams are
composed of salespeople (SPs), and our technical subject matter experts,
the solution consultants (SCs). Since we did not hire solution
consultants at the same pace (which is not possible due to special
expertise requirements), we broke a delicate balance that existed
undisturbed in our teams for a long while. We now have an organization
with a character quite different from what it was just 6 months ago. It
is well understood by senior staff that the SP to SC ratio is critical,
and this has become a point of issue. These are the two primary players
in our client facing sales teams, and interaction need to be as smooth
and effective as possible, with minimal dead weight. SC time is
valuable, since they cover many salespeople. SC experience is critical,
because without it SPs would have little ability to validate
opportunities and align connect client issues to our software offerings.
Most other roles in the company play a supporting role to these teams
either by providing mentorship, direction, or tools for success. These
teams, connected directly with the senior management of our important
clients (C-level), are there the key connection point to our market at
the highest level. Furthermore, they are involved in every aspect of our
organization’s mission, and are important to the corporate culture as a
whole, because they make up such a large portion of our total staff.</p>
<p>It is well known that the salespeople have starkly different skill
sets and experience than our SCs. Salespeople manage the relationships
while the SCs, as technical subject matter experts, understand the
product and can validate alignment with customer requirements. There are
fewer SCs than SPs because their knowledge is very difficult to come by,
and their base salaries are high. Many of these employees are nearly (if
not actually) indispensable. It is vital that they have a voice in the
larger organization, and their opinions need to be sought by management
(Ashford et al, 2003). Previously SC organizations had significant
influence, and this was recently diminished. This has impacted their
perceptions of equitability and this presents a risk that key employees
sensitive to this might leave (Green, 2018a; Green, 2018b; Rollins &amp;
Judge, 2012). The small SP/SC teams are highly interdependent, and are
unlikely to succeed in isolation of one another, and function as a true
team versus a mere group (Green, 2018c, p. 14). They make up a unit that
connects directly with a client in a dynamic way. Our product offering
is very complex, and since SCs each must support many SPs, they cannot
devote themselves entirely to all opportunities, and should quickly
detect and report unqualified opportunities. Historically this
arrangement has been successful and manageable with a maximum ratio of
4:1. Managers and Directors have been careful to control this to ensure
the balance was optimal, and this delicate balance has been maintained
for many years, creating many satisfied employees and customers.</p>
<p>Now, with the massive influx of sales people, due to top-down
decision making from outside our division, in a well-intentioned hiring
spree that seems hard to justify in retrospect, we have ratios of 8:1,
and even 10:1, converting functional teams to mere groups of people
(Green 2018c). This dramatically altered the dynamic of these groups,
and has stretched the technical resources thin, leaving SPs with no
product expertise to confirm opportunities. Because of the complexity of
our working environment, our product, our market, our sales pipeline,
and projections, we have encountered unforeseen issues. Even company
culture has been impacted—and that requires immediate attention since
culture is usually fixed/frozen until key moments of critical importance
(Green, 2018e). Once there is disillusionment about company life, many
aspects of the company will be called into question that were previously
followed without much self-reflection (Green, 2018e).</p>
<p>Firsthand observations within all the teams is key to getting a feel
for this situation. I worked in this environment and have made many
observations. First, our sales team is becoming desperate because they
do not have adequate support from SCs and have few real opportunities in
the pipeline. Oftentimes they are unable to tell the difference. They
are beginning to cling to unwinnable opportunities and are inflating
projections to create hopes in order to buy time. Secondly, since the
issue is so common, aggregate projections on quarterly reports are
overstated, and quarterly business meetings are reduced to speculation
using cooked books. Thirdly, the probability of conversion of many of
the opportunities are overstated, because new sales staff are unable to
correctly position products to customer needs. Many big deals in our
forecast have no chance of success. Of the 200 million projected, I
suspect 50 million is possible. Fourth, SCs are more aware of the issues
than the rest of the organization, but are scared to provide feedback,
because of the power and size of the sales groups. Feedback-seeking
behavior is absent in management, and this is a poor sign (Ashford,
2003). Fifth, the SCs are already aware that they will not get paid
their commissions because targets will be missed. This has lead to bad
morale and foreboding, and with a diminished voice due to the focus on
the sales teams, they feel ineffective. They are aware that they cannot
make their promised incomes, but worse still, the they know the sales
teams will be even more adversely impacted, creating hostility. Sixth,
management is working with poor information, since so many salespeople
are inventing numbers and misjudging the opportunities. On the technical
side, directors and managers complain that the staffing numbers and
financial projections don’t compute, and that sales estimations are off.
However, this information seems to be covered up by the SP teams and
management, or ignored with renewed commitment seemingly due to
escalation bias (Green, 2018d, p. 38)</p>
<p>There are widespread financial issues stemming simply from excessive
on-boarding. This is because those hired are setting false projections,
and we will fall far short of expectations and disappoint. We will be
unable to pay commissions and will have to report back to corporate that
our division is underperforming in relation to the rest of the company.
Uncontrolled this problem will only worsen.</p>
<h2
id="recommended-solution-and-benefits-return-to-our-previous-team-compositions"><a name="recommended-solution-and-benefits">Recommended
Solution and Benefits: Return to Our Previous Team Compositions</a></h2>
<p>My recommended solution is to gradually restructure our many teams to
resemble what existed and worked previously. This focus on renewing our
previous team structure will allow us to address the over-hiring issue
without adversely impacting everything else that matters. We should work
towards teams that have the following properties: 1) Team ratios that
are not greater than 4:1 for SPs/SCs. 2) Ensure that both the SPs and
SCs are knowledgeable about their markets by sharing information and
working on training. 3) Expect fast and honest feedback from everyone
with an emphasis on expanding the influence of solutions consulting to
improve management’s data, since their feedback has been absent (Ashford
et. al, 2003). This should correct our quarterly business meetings and
allow us to plan with real numbers in place, rather than double to
triple those numbers.</p>
<p>As you will notice, a strict 4:1 ratio is not possible now, with a
sales staff of 240, and technical sales staff of 30. We can approach the
previous structure, with a 6:4:1 ratio, providing only indirect solution
consulting support to junior sales members who should be training with
senior sales. Thus, they can shadow, and still get SP support, while
receiving minimal SC support. They will receive disappointing
commissions, but that is inevitable given poor opportunities they have
to pursue. Clearly, we cannot sustain even this, but that is due to the
imbalance from hiring that cannot be fixed without some attrition. This
is also a strategy to remove sales staff who are not contributing or
working hard to find a place. It must be done in the least damaging way
possible, either by offering incentives to leave, or by some other
method to be described in a separate process. Either way, the goal is to
protect the locus of our success (our many sales teams of SPs/SCs), with
the expectation that excess hires will ultimately leave the
organization. This is important because we need to admit and cut losses,
rather than to continue to trend of falling into cognitive dissonance,
trying to justify our original hiring decisions, and escalation of
commitment by doubling down on irrational projections of the salespeople
(Green, 2018d).</p>
<p>Most of the benefits of this solution relate to preservation and
damage control instead of business growth. While this is disappointing,
the result of this solution will be an intact business that remains in
operation with less severe impacts. Using this approach, the
long-developed company culture will be preserved. We will be able to
address the problem itself gradually, while re-establishing what
previously worked in the organization. The best part of this solution is
that it is being called for by senior managers, particularly directors
who have been employed by the company, some for well over 10 years. It
will result in a cultural reaffirmation that everyone has bought into,
and that everyone still supports, and would be uncomfortable changing
(due to still being “frozen” (Green, 2018e, p. 42). People are not yet
disillusioned about the prospects of reverting back to the former models
and are still hopeful that leadership will listen to this advice. This
makes implementation realistic, versus introducing something entirely
new.</p>
<h2
id="structured-implementation-plan"><a name="structured-implementation-plan">Structured
Implementation Plan</a></h2>
<p>This solution can be implemented with the following approach:</p>
<p><strong>Phase I.</strong> Validation Phase: While I’m confident that
this matches the data and the life of the company, I think it is
important for leadership to take steps to confirm using sound methods of
getting real feedback from key employees, and end the culture of silence
impacting those who are risk averse (Ashford, 2003; Green, 2018d, pp
43-53).</p>
<p><strong>Phase II.</strong> Management Buy-in Phase: Communicate to
managers and directors the nature of the issue and the desire to follow
their recommendations to get back to a team structure resembling the
ones we had before. Be matter of fact and not alarmist and remain
hopeful about the future. Acknowledge them for their commitment, their
past successes, and ask for their help, to recreate out teams. Support
them in how to communicate the information downwards.</p>
<p><strong>Phase III.</strong> Team reformation (minor), Placing New
Hires in Periphery: Have management reform the teams to earlier
structures, making special effort to gain buy in from seasoned staff
members and those who are especially skilled and knowledgeable. Support
the team reformation phase by announcing it at the next scheduled
all-hands meeting.</p>
<p><strong>Phase IV.</strong> Graceful Handling of Employee Exits: Under
this plan it is expected that many employees will become dissatisfied.
These employees will have a case for exiting based on non-realization of
commissions. Plans for employee layoffs or company exits will be
outlined in a separate recommendation from this document. This process
will certainly cover the importance of containing dissatisfaction, and
for decreasing the visibility of employee layoffs. We must plan
carefully about how non-exiting employees will perceive these changes,
and minimize impacts to perks, benefits and compensation, and offer
termination compensation if it is cost effective.</p>
