<h1>Self-hypnosis Script</h1>
<h2>Main goals</h2>
<ul>
<li>Progressive relaxation of muscles</li>
<li>Creation of switches for activating quick calm and relaxation</li>
<li>Self-help for changing physiological reactions to stressors</li>
<li>Quick rest and restoration</li>
<li>Recovery of positive mood and outlook</li>
<li>Relief from anxiety and stress</li>
</ul>
<p>There are four primary steps in this self hypnosis script (also described here: <a href="https://freehypnosisscripts.info/scripts#induction">https://freehypnosisscripts.info/scripts#induction</a>)</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Induction.</strong> Initiating the meditative process from ordinary daily activity</li>
<li><strong>Deepening.</strong> Attaining an increasingly deep state of relaxation and receptivity to autosuggestion.</li>
<li><strong>Autosuggestion.</strong> Autosuggestion is basically self talk. This is the part that relates to standard hypnosis.</li>
<li><strong>Awakening.</strong> The process of transitioning from deep relaxation to fully conscious clarity, to resume the day.</li>
</ol>
<p>The main procedure in the script is to slowly move into a relaxed state, and gradually go deeper and deeper into relaxation. Depth of relaxation is increased with practice. At a very deep level of relaxation, self talk is initiated. We are more receptive to ideas at a subconscious level while in this state. After this, a brief procedure is followed to &quot;wake.&quot; The feeling on waking is often euphoria, calmness, clarity and acceptance of the world as it is.</p>
<p>This script takes 30 to 40 minutes initially, including setup. Most time is spent achieving a deep state of relaxation. Once mastered the entire process can take less than 20 minutes. Soon you can activate skills instantly whenever needed, at any time during the day. Once I was able to relax my facial muscles with ease, I found that I could gain calm and focus simply by relaxing my face. Similarly I had the same experience if I merely touched my pointer fingers to my thumbs. Since I did this everytime I used self-hypnosis, I became conditioned to relate this movement to deep relaxation.</p>
<p>The entire process is very flexible. The script is just recipe to get started. Later you will modify it and make it your own process.</p>
<h2>Setup</h2>
<ul>
<li>Find a comfortable place to site, preferably in a slightly reclined position.</li>
<li>Remove any clothing or jewelry that is tight or constricting. This is more important than it seems to be.</li>
<li>Take shoes off, socks as well if they are tight or constricting.</li>
<li>Make sure the environment is mostly devoid of sounds, and is a comfortable telmperature.</li>
<li>Sit with arms and legs open and not crossed. Palms open, or pointer fingers touching thumbs.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Script</h2>
<p>Total time required: 30-40 minutes.</p>
<h3>Induction (5 - 10 minutes)</h3>
<p>Breath slowly in and out with eyes open initially. Take 3-4 seconds inhaling, and 3-4 seconds exhaling. Keep that slow and steady pace. Begin to count through the list below, saying each item to yourself, as you exhale. Slowly close eyes as you repeat these thoughts, with increasing calmness:</p>
<ol>
<li>I am calm and comfortable.</li>
<li>I am relaxed.</li>
<li>Nothing can bother me.</li>
<li>Sounds do not disturb me.</li>
<li>I am becoming more relaxed.</li>
<li>I am resting.</li>
<li>I am in control.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Deepening (15-20 minutes):</h3>
<p>Imagine a place you know well that has an elevator, escalator, or stairwell. Your eyes are closed.</p>
<p>You slowly descend, and as you descend you speak softly to yourself. You can forever be more relaxed, and can go deeper and deeper. After 7 steps you repeat the process, until you feel ready for the next steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>I'm going deeper.</li>
<li>I'm becoming more relaxed.</li>
<li>My breathing is easy.</li>
<li>My mind is clear.</li>
<li>I am focused.</li>
<li>I'm becoming more relaxed.</li>
<li>I am very relaxed.</li>
</ol>
<p>Next you focus very carfully on your immediate bodily sensations. Try not to think with words, except to remind yourself of the process. Move from your body from bottom to top: focus on your fingers, then your lower legs, then upper legs, then torso, then upper arms, lower arms, fingers, then focus on your face.</p>
<h3>I am heavy</h3>
<ul>
<li>I am very heavy. I am like heavy metal, pulling down on my chair.</li>
<li>My feet are pulling downward into the earth.</li>
<li>My calves are like weights hanging from my knees</li>
<li>My legs and lower torso are pushing hard into the seat of the chair. They could go through the chair.</li>
</ul>
<p>.. continue for remainder of body.</p>
<h3>I am light</h3>
<ul>
<li>I am very very light. I am lighter than air.</li>
<li>Imagine a cloud and clear skies.</li>
<li>I am floating up, pulling out of my seat.</li>
<li>My feet are tingling, and are pulling upwards.</li>
<li>My legs and torso could lift from the chair.</li>
</ul>
<h3>I am cool</h3>
<ul>
<li></li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<h3>I am hot</h3>
<ul>
<li></li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<h3>Autosuggestion (5 minutes)</h3>
<p>This part you create yourself. It is about visualization and self affirmation.</p>
<ul>
<li>I am confident</li>
<li>When I'm in class, I can speak and remain like this. Calm and unaffected.</li>
<li>I will improve</li>
<li>I am calm and focused</li>
</ul>
<h3>Awakening (3 - 5 minutes)</h3>
<ul>
<li>I am slowly waking.</li>
<li>My mind is becoming clear.</li>
<li>I am focused on my surroundings.</li>
<li>The air is comfortable.</li>
<li>This seat is firm.</li>
<li>My eyes are opening</li>
<li>The light is clear</li>
<li>My mind is open</li>
<li>I can see very clearly</li>
<li>I can feel</li>
<li>I feel good</li>
<li>I am ready to wake up</li>
</ul>
