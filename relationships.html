<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Relationships is a somewhat more humorous part of my personal form
and system of life-categories. My main interest when I first included
this on my form was to remind myself of people who should have some
importance in my world for various reasons, and to make sure to think
about them and reflect on how I could maintain positive communication
with them. When I was young, calling someone on the phone to stay in
touch was not natural. It was very uncomfortable. I’d have to build up
some courage and be ready prepared with things to talk about, and not
simply pick up the phone and call someone impromptu. Today, I’m much
more adept with phone calls and conference calls became a routine part
of my life. But sometimes, even today, I do feel a strong reluctance to
call. Anyway, earlier in life this was more debilitating. It was
something I really needed to overcome to ensure I was able to progress
on anything that had a social component. I think the cause was not using
the phone often while growing up, and being somewhat isolated from
adults, and needs that would require this type of communication. I was
born in 1980 and during that time rarely needed a phone for anything at
all, and even in the 90s cell phones were absent. I did not get my first
cell phone until perhaps 1999 or 2000. It was a plain nokia cell phone,
somewhat small compared to modern smart phones, but was an old-fashioned
compact cell phone. Before that I had my own phone line for my bedroom
for a period, but before that relied entirely on the same phone line as
my family. Usually for needs my parents would make calls, and I would
not. The purpose of a phone call was primarily at that time to let my
parents know where I was at dinner time, if I was not at home. Then I
would inform them I was at a friends house, and would promptly come home
for the evening. In this type of world phone calls were not the norm.
There was no special need to reach out to anyone to keep a relationship
going. Most people I knew and spent time with were in my neighborhood. I
had very few business relationships and no need to call businesses. The
phone, at that time, for me, was really a somewhat fearful thing to use.
If I called someone who I did not know, what would I say…? It would
produce anxiety, and later this became really important to overcome.</p>
<p>Similarly I had some issues simply talking to people I did not know.
Walking up to a stranger in certain environments was very awkward, and I
had a strong aversion to getting a job that would involve customer
service, and long periods of work talking to people I was not sure I
could satisfy.</p>
<p>These issues were overcome but there were deliberate efforts to
ensure that I would get past them. I don’t think these are very unusual
though, as kids certainly grow up with comfort in their own family, but
with discomfort about strangers who at first, are people to be avoided.
Oddly, strangers turn out to be more helpful than family later in life,
but that is something that is learned later. I think most will have
stages of development related to gaining comfort communicating and being
exposed to other people, on the phone or in person, or otherwise.</p>
<p>The main purpose of the relationship categories in my twenties,
around 2003 to 2008, was to give mental attention to friends and family
and ensure contact. I would force myself to call friends who lived
elsewhere during this time and became quite good at maintaining
relationships. In retrospect, while I was uncomfortable talking on the
phone, whereas they did not seem uncomfortable, I was the only one who
had the discipline in use of the form to call at all. So it turned out
that I was the primary cause of the maintenance of the relationships
during those periods of time of greater separation. Most others would
simply gravitate towards other people in their more immediate
occupations and let relationships fade away. I did not experience a fade
in my relationships as a result, in the same way that others experienced
it. My same friends remained my friends until I was about forty, quite
recently, when I decided I no longer wanted to put in the efforts that
others themselves would not put in. And fascinatingly, those
relationships terminated as one might expect. This is not only about
phone calls however. I would include travel as a means to ensure
continued relations. So if I moved away, or a friend moved away, I would
make sure to pay visits. However they did not provide visits, so once I
stopped talking on the phone, and travelling to see them, there was
nothing to maintain the relationships further.</p>
<p>The relationships section though was very useful in cultivating a
better social life, that could develop. I used a similar approach in my
career, about forcing myself to keep contact and ties and maintain
relationships and initiate new ones. Later, after discontinuing use of
the form, I would do interviews with different companies all while I was
employed, without any intention to leave my job. This made it so I
stayed current on being able to converse over the phone in expected
ways, and kept me up to date on the market. I would know what recruiters
and interviewers were looking for. I anticipated bad interviews, but
because I did not require any occupation, being already employed, did
not care. It was to keep up relationships and ability to relate, and
open possibilities in my career. While the interviewing did not have the
intention of leaving the current job, and I would continue interviewing
even while happily employed, this approach was the cause of getting new
jobs, because suddenly opportunities would arise that were the ones that
would cause me to leave, even if I did not have that intention. For
example, I was doing interviews while I was somewhat happily employed as
an architect in Nashua, New Hampshire, at Fidelity Investments. After a
number of interviews, I was suddenly called by Adobe Systems to take a
job as a solution consultant, which is a technical sales person far
along in career (it is the same title as that had by Edward Snowden).
Fidelity was happy with my performance and had already prepared to
extend my contract another year, when I informed them that I was going
to transition to Adobe. This opportunity and my ability to get the role,
was directly related to my willingness to continue to do interviews, and
this all traces back to my interest in having and maintaining
relationships, by making sure I continued to do phone calls with people
I cared about.</p>
<p>I’ve told people many times, and have it recorded into my Facebook
profile, that I have dual relationship interests. I like living in an
urban environment and a country environment. I like solitude and nature
but I also enjoy being around people. I envisioned being a hermit later
in life, while at the same time being someone accomplished in work and
exposed to stimulation of urban life. My locations of residences
reflectd this as I wanted good outdoors and places I could enjoy being
alone, but also had plenty of restaurants and night life, and cultural
places to spend time around others. While I’ve been intensely interested
in having positive relationships with friends, family, and colleagues
over the year, I have shifted to wanting to be more a hermit and less
sociable, recently. I still want to be around others and to have access
to a good market, and spend quite a lot of time out at coffee houses,
restaurants, and the gym, but I do so in a way that is solitary. My
personal form today will not have the same emphasis it had before. I’ve
already achieved what I wanted in relationships and now what I’m wanting
to do is find a way to beincreasingly comfortable and confident being
totally alone. I was divorced 4 years ago from a 19 year relationship,
and in Anchorage Alaska, the Southwest, and Hawaii, I’m very far from
old friends and family who reside on the east coast of the United
States. I’m not wanting to travel there, or be around people I know, or
even people I’ve seen somewhat often, like neighbors or people who visit
the same places in town over and over. I want to be around strangers,
and be alone most of the time. Confessedly, I’m not sure quite yet what
needs to be maintained in this category on my personal form. I will
include developments here but my instinct is to think I need to include
strategies on how to omit people, and cope with people who try to force
themselves into my life, and not at all include a section on people who
I need to remember to stay in touch with. I can feel probably there are
strategies I’m not aware of that I can make use of, and so perhaps there
is a real area to develop in my life using this life-category, that had
a totally different interest and mission earlier.</p>
<h2 id="the-many-errors-of-the-populace-regarding-morality.">The many
errors of the populace regarding morality.</h2>
<p>Many of who we would like to think are intelligent in the populations
of the earth have made some incredible mistakes regarding their
moralities, and much concerning these errors is accounted for in choice
of relationship, and mistakes concerning the value of relationships and
their impact on beliefs and views about what is honest.</p>
<p>It appears even supposedly intelligent people worldwide have been
unable to stay honest as to certain things plainly false that are
obviously and easily logically falsified, which can be found partially
on my <a href="lists.html">lists page</a>.</p>
<p>Instead of being able to clearly think through aspects of life to
arrive at real answers even intelligent people have altered their own
points of view to correspond to the most foolish and stupid perspectives
of populace. This is plainly a mistake guided by poor moral ideas
concerning the value of relationships. Relationships are simultaneously
considered as important enough to guide people towards truthfulness and
honesty, to create mutual veracity to increase the supposed
meaningfulness of life. However, instead of having this result, people
have allowed dishonest people in their environment to steer their
thinking to unclarity and dishonesty, even on the most basic of topics,
where an advanced primate that really is honest can understand
immediately.</p>
<p>Personally I will <em>never</em>, <em>for anyone</em> adopt
superstitions of any kind. To me that is akin to becoming as foolish as
one can possibly become. This is one of my many reasons for wanting to
remain somewhat isolated from others. Since even those who think
themselves intelligent with some justification fall into superstitions,
there is hardly anyone on Earth who will not try to press me and others
into what must be considerd the antithesis of a quality worldview.</p>
<p>People allow their many relations to tell them other foolish things
as well, and somehow they come to repeat the same, for example that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Their lives are hard.</li>
<li>That they need to be saved.</li>
<li>That their only options for life-guidance are ancient views.</li>
<li>That superstitions are true.</li>
<li>That relationships are more valuable than honesty (what of honesty
in relationships?).</li>
<li>That Israel or the Vatican, or some certain cities hold special
value.</li>
<li>That there are aliens, and the like…</li>
</ul>
<p>These foolish views are so pervasive it is hard to believe that we
are not primitives. The things which confuse us into thinking people are
not primitives appear to be artifacts that we assume to indicate
advancement. I look outside this coffee house, away from the numerous
fools which fill it, to my vehicle, and the parking lot and roadway with
lines of other vehicles. By these I’m to suppose that we’ve completed
moral philosophy, when the reality is that nobody has started yet?</p>
<p>“Thank you for the afterlife” is something I commonly think to myself
these days. Do you not know that you are an imbecile, thinking you’re
the gatekeeper of the afterlife? You control the portal to the
netherworld? You have a friend who is a Jew who <em>does</em> have a
portal to the afterlife?</p>
<p>Being a moral philosopher who <em>has</em> come to an understanding
of what a good philosophy is, and a good system for personal guidance
consists of, cares about the well being of animals including primates.
But primates who have adopted a religion or a nationality get no special
attention from me as having any authority, and actually I assume
nowadays that they can only detract me from my much better mentality. I
do not want any relationships that are selling me fools superstitions,
of people who claim they have hard lives, and that they simultaneously
are expert on miracles and stewards of the childish afterlife.</p>
<p>Knowing you would help me how?</p>
<p><a name="subtraction-of-relationships"></a></p>
<h2 id="subtraction-of-relations">Subtraction of Relations</h2>
<p>Another current effort underway is subtraction of relationships. I
noticed that a major issue in antiquated religious morality and cultural
advice is that it hasn’t tackled unlearning and removal of unwanted
parts of mental life.</p>
<p>To give an example. Supposed you are raped or harmed. Suppose you
have a vocabulary which includes ways of thinking you’d like to avoid.
Racial slurs come to mind. Nobody has covered what it takes to really
remove these from you and the culture, such that they are not
reintroduced into you, and so that you can finally thinking as much as
possible about what you want to think about, and not what others force
on you.</p>
<p>Sometimes what has been forced on you are other people.</p>
<p>You cannot choose your family when you are raised, the people who are
in the vicinity, your neighbors, and people you were stuck with at
school. Going further into the deterministic aspect of life, you really
don’t control any interaction totally, and anyone who did appear in your
life appeared there due to physical rules in nature, including physical
rules in your own mind which lead you to decide where to go and where to
be. However, people who ended up in your world were there not because of
your decision making but because of physical predetermination.</p>
<p>In my life, I want to continue to improve myself. I want to develop
further with new interactions, experiences, people and new stimulation
in arts, in locations, in travel, in reading and what have you. In order
to do this more effectively I want to spend less time reminiscing. I’m
not really the nostalgic type. Periodically I will enjoy my own
photographs, and reflections on my life, but I’m not clinging to
anything in my history, and I’m not clinging to any people either. There
are some people I’m especially not clinging to: those who prestented a
risk to me because they put me in danger, were threatening, or were of
bad quality. Instead of clinging to these, obviously, I would prefer not
to continue including them in my mind thinknig about them further. These
people I prefer to remove, or obstruct, or disfigure in my
consciousness, until they do not appear or seem unrecognizable.</p>
<p>It’s not only about relationships to people who I’ve met, but people
on television too. I don’t know Seinfeld. I prefer to never think of
Seinfeld again, or characters from the 90s, or earlier, or later and not
very recent. I prefer to meet strangers, see new things, find new art,
entertainment, etc… Yesterday I saw the Mona Lisa again on social media.
While I want that to exist and remain protected, I have no need really
to see or hear it ever again, or at least not until I really want
to.</p>
<p>I’ve created a page called <a
href="subtraction.html">Subtraction</a>. The purpose of this page is to
work on methods of subtraction, distortion and erasure. It shows in
images what I’m also doing mentally on a day to day basis. If I see
someone in my mind that I do not want to think about, I really do blur
their face, bend it, contort it, blot it out, fog it, or perform some
other mental trick to make it clear to my mind that it needs to go.</p>
<p>Anyone who wants to “move on” would understand that such an approach
might be the only way easily available for getting rid of unwanted
thoughts and thinking. The culture, again, has not provided a toolkit
for eliminating unwanted parts of life from recollection. It’s not
necessarily about totally eliminating unwanted thinking, but of reducing
recollectivity. Frequencies of thoughts, ruminations, and even
obsessions some might have. I’m not the obsessive type, but I do want to
remove certain recollections, particularly when they start to intrude on
contexts in which they are inapplicable or unrelated. Suppose you
relocate to a new country, or to a new region, and what you keep
thinking about is someone you knew elsewhere who harmed you seriously.
Is it not better to find a way to forget them, particularly if the
objective of relocation may have been to find something new, and to
begin reflecting on what is in the new environment, replacing the old.
Not thinking, still, on what is old and, kinda dead in the world?</p>
<p>Another thought I had when I was young was that entertainment and
media seems to be lifeless. Consider if you are watching any older
television show you like, or are listening to some older music at a
period of your life in which you were within the culture. Now you
reexperience it much later. It feels like everyone in that recording has
moved on, is having a different life, and yet, you are listening to
sounds and are seeing sights generated by technology from inert
materials. Likewise, simply remembering something has a similar
characteristic. You have recorded within you something that might not be
remembered by anyone else. They moved on, you did too, but what is
happening is a regeneration from living material. But notice the quality
is low. So in a sense it is even worse than recollecting from the inert
material, and this is a reason why people want the inert recordings so
badly, because their ability to make use feel we recognize it completely
and can reexperience it, requires something with really good fidelity.
You cling to pictures because, perhaps, you have recollections of
fragments of images, or blurred images, or foggy imperfect images. But
what if you don’t even want those, so that you have any kind of yearning
for seeing the real thing, or seeing copies? A method for removing them
further might be to blur them or blot them out. Consider that is what
your mind is doing and that is what sometimes you revolt against when
you want to rely on a recording. You want to preserve the memory, but
your mind seems built for, or has as a side effect, gradual, slow
deterioration of memories. Some you want to keep and of course for that
you have photographs and videos, or you rehearse your memories. But for
those you don’t want to remember, you can perhaps work with your systems
functions by forcing deterioration, or by helping it fail to recollect.
In this way people perhaps can move on and continue to develop.</p>
<p>Once not to long ago I was telling a friend that “open mindedness”
must include closed-mindedness. Suppose you want to remain open to new
experiences and learn more. Some things have to be closed off from
reconsideration to have time available to think through new things.
Likewise, being stuck in time does not permit openness to new
experiences. This is why I said to continue developing I want to focus
on new things and remove what is unwanted. In this way removal of old
people and old experiences opens resources for new experiences.</p>
<p>Thought about this way it seems sad if someone had a limited life
with limited experiences and that person <em>also</em> opts to cling to
early experiences, shutting out new possibilities.</p>
<p>Another observation I had when I was travelling quite a lot was that
life seems longer if you travel. The observation is this: if I went on a
road trip, or a trip that had a lot of new places to see, things to do,
and perhaps new culture, I could remember each detail of the trip even
far into the future without trying. A week might feel like a month or
two. However, if I’m going to attempt to recall some mundane repetitive
period in my life, and I choose a particular week, I might hardly
remember much of it at all. It will not resemble the same level of
memory in relation to time as any vacation I had. So closing off history
and remaining open to new experiences, and creating new enviornments,
seeing new people, and learning new things, really does have a
relationship with being open to new experiences and being open minded,
and having that depends on being closed too.</p>
<p>Part of my life in relationships is to find ways to close off what is
old and move on to new, extending perhaps this idea concerning travel,
what people already say about meeting new people, and also mental
tactics on preventing unwanted recurring thoughts, which may not be
desirable even if they are not obsessive. If obsessive I can imagine one
might really want tools to remove and prevent, and maybe some of these
tools would work for the obsessive too. Again, the page I’m working on
that is a visual representation of what I’m already doing in my mind
primarily is <a href="subtraction.html">Subtraction</a>.</p>
<p><a name="attention-and-relationships"></a></p>
<h3 id="attention-and-relationships">Attention and Relationships</h3>
<p>A few years ago I wrote a booklet on achieving a better level of
attention for goods and excellences in one’s life. A takeaway is that a
wise person would strictly control environments to ensure they are
suitable to one’s purposes of achieving various goals and personal
virtues. This relates to relationships because not only does one want to
be in spaces that are safe which implies certain people are not nearby,
but also one chooses spaces so that one can make certain relationships
possible. Consider if you get into college you want the presence of high
quality people inside and outside of the school, you want good teachers,
and you want friends who will want to mutually develop with you, and not
simply obstruct, hinder, or only have fun in your presence. There is
much more to this idea about finding ways to improve attention to have a
better life, but it is well known in the normal vertical mobility path,
in that people who gain funds will use those funds to have artful,
pleasant, and luxurious surroundings, and any other surroundings that
seem wise to have, if the person who is vertically mobile has any
inkling about the need to manage attention. They don’t typically go back
to living in a less high quality environment, unless they have specific
objectives related to that type of choice.</p>
<p><a
href="imagination-and-filtration-dark-green-notebook.html">Imagination
and Filtration (Higher Order Attention)</a></p>
<p>This work will be more fully edited and developed as I come to
completion of my system of ethics that I’ve been producing over two
decades. This section on life categories as I’ve said before is related
to tactical decisions in life, which relates to behavior and what might
be called practical ethics. Higher Order Attention relates to what might
be historically called theoretical ethics, or higher level strategy on
practical ethics. I don’t see a huge distinction between the two, but
traditionally there is a division, and while I eschew much that has
already been written on moral philosophy, I think more needs to be
stated on this point. For now I’ll merely mention that Higher Order
Attention seems more strategic and psychological than a division of life
along life categories for training on key areas, which includes this
topic of relationships.</p>
<p><a name="strangers-and-randoms"></a></p>
<h3 id="strangers-and-randoms">Strangers and Randoms</h3>
<p><em>Saturday, June 30<sup>th</sup>, 2022, at 8:26 PM Alaska
Time</em></p>
<p>Also of recent interest is the perception of relationships of other
people who appear in my environment, or those I end up nearby to in
public spaces; also, my relationships to others who might think they
know something about me, or have read something I’ve written, or who’ve
heard something from others that make them believe they have some
relationship.</p>
<p>Before I procured property in Alaska where I ended up having many
unwanted neighbors, and people living nearby believing they had some
interest in my life, or some relationship to me, there were few times I
really had any interest in the way relationships could arise with
strangers. People who existed nearby, or appeared suddenly, or those who
I put myself near to in public spaces, had very little interest to me as
far as legal risks were concerned. The few times I can remember having
any concern were when I encountered people who appeared to be dangerous
in some way—people who had characteristics that seemed to indicate they
were too aggressive, seemingly interested, or threatening. These people
I would quickly disassociate from, or create space from. There was no
difficulty achieving the necessary separation quickly with most people
who presented some kind of risk. There were a few colleagues, I was
forced to work with who seemed to have poor character traits, and I was
not able to easily extricate myself from having to be near them, but
still, the risks were not so great to be really concerned about long
term legal interests, or threats to ongoing well-being.</p>
<p>Now, however, there are many new risks from people who appear in my
environment or claim to have some relationship to me. I have more than
one neighbor who perpetually makes unwanted contact, or contact that is
greatly unpreferred. I also have people who have some understanding
through hearsay, through knowledge about my social media presence, or my
writing, who pretend in public to have some relationship with me.</p>
<p>Another example is when someone repeatedly uses a space that is
shared. People who appear at the same business, or near to you at other
locations in town, or in a city. These people, having seen me more than
once, get interested in establishing a more durable contact. However,
given my experience that is typically totally unwanted.</p>
<p>I think many of these concerns must be similar to the concerns of
people who have been historically targeted: minorities at risk,
foreigners, and famous individuals. People who prompt attention, not due
to their own cause but the cause of the beliefs of others, in which they
later pretend they have some relationship to you.</p>
<p>This portion of my interest in relationships is closely related to
risk management. In this case, risk management relating to people who
are not known, in a cultural context that includes legal and physical
risks.</p>
<p>The position I’ve taken with neighbors has been that nobody is a
friend. I will tell people openly or in writing, that I do not consider
them to be friends, but rather, that they are people with a mutual
interest which is specific, and in relation to that specific interest,
I’m wiling to engage in certain required activities. The purpose is to
make clear to the other person that any interaction would be minimal,
and would not exceed what is considered civil, as it relates to certain
necessary transactions.</p>
<p>I recognized that any belief in the other that there is something
more durable, of being a “friend” or a “neighbor” can be confusing and
can created legal risks and ramifications. Firstly, it allows them some
claim to special knowledge or information, which in our culture can
cause mental depictions to arise that are not at all minimal. Instead,
they can bring thoughts of other friendships, and other neighborly
relations, and perspectives about these relations, that can be
incorrectly transferred to my situation. I do not want any thoughts
about someone else’s more developed and less minimal relationships of
friendship, and their ideals and expectations around friendships and
neighborly relationships to relate to what I state myself about my
relationships, and the nature of my relationships. To give one example,
I am not religious. A very big error would be for someone to perceive or
think they have a special relationship to me that is defined in their
religion, simply because of the concepts they use. In Christianity,
there are thoughts about what friendship and neighborly relations might
be, and might entail, or require. However, I’m not Christian and I don’t
at all share any agreement as to these concepts, their meaning, and
their obligations, or that there are any obligations.</p>
<h4 id="space-and-mind-and-strangers">Space and Mind and Strangers</h4>
<p>Today I was thinking through how one might explain my perspective at
a basic level, regarding risk mitigation and avoidance.</p>
<p>In my perspective, if someone appears in my environment, it does not
mean I have any relationship to them. That two people would come to be
able to see each other when nearby happenstance in a public location is
not unexpected. There are few ways that people would ever see each other
as strangers or randoms without this occurrence. It is also known, that
simply because people come into the same space, such that they can see
each other, does not entail any relationship, along relationship
classifications. For example, if I see someone I don’t know at a coffee
business, it does not mean that I have any durable relationship. I have
not been introduced, and I am not acquainted. Even if there was an
introduction, it does not mean that I desire any additional contact, or
any durable category of transaction. To give an example of what I mean
by that, if I see a neighbor in public who I seldom if ever see near my
home, it does not mean I want to speak to that person, or carry on any
neighborly transactions in public. I prefer not even to think of them as
a neighbor. That is a stranger who has a possession somewhat near to a
possession I have. Seeing that person in public, it does not mean that I
have any obligations, or that I have any special legal requirements on
me. This person to me is still a stranger, or random. If I know less
then they are more a stranger and a random. We all understand what
strangers are, and we all know that there are strangers who we would not
want more than is required by combining people haphazardly in a public
setting. If a stranger appears in your environment, or my environment,
it does not mean there are special obligations.</p>
<p>However, I have found that despite this, people still pose a risk.
There are those who appear in public spaces who think that by being
present and near me, I have some obligations to them which do not exist.
Of looking a certain way, of behaving a certain way, and of placating
them socially somehow by appearing to be socially inviting. Typically,
for me, however, I am not socially inviting. Instead, I want no
relationship and prefer to repel people to an extent to keep myself from
developing unwanted relations. For others who are expecting to be
invited socially, to concede some social time and some kind attention
and behavior, their rejection is a risk. I will reject them and repel
them. Doing so, they may come to think they can take certain adverse
actions against me, not recognizing there are no obligations to be
inviting.</p>
<p>There are also those who are really a bit like fans, or people who
claim to have some knowledge which permits them to create obligations.
Hearsay information, or gossip-knowledge, does not for me create
introductions. It does not create any acquaintanceship either. Often,
the pathway of the information is not known. The way they came to think
they know me at all might be from someone quite adverse. It could also
be through someone who is more friendly. It is acknowledged, however,
that even among those who are friendly, are poor information holders and
poor communicators, and people who might not have good judge of
character. In any case, people who have come to some tidbits of
information about me have not been vetted by me. I have not been the
judge of their characters, and I have not used the information to arrive
at any desire for additional relationship development. While it is
possible that that could be something I would want, if I did not want
it, and a person simply has pieces of information second-hand, it means
to me they really are still strangers, and that I have no obligation of
any kind to them. I don’t need to be socially solicitous of their
conversation, or especially inviting. I don’t have to appear in any way
for them either, in clothing, or in kindness. In other words, I don’t
have to smile, or put on an act for them.</p>
<p>In locations that are extremely urban, like in New York City, or in
London, this would be very well understood. There are so many people in
such living areas, that most social contacts in public would be visual,
and even visual relations may be quite transitory. Since there are many
strangers, attention would shift rapidly, and it wold be very obvious
that walking in crowds would diminish the perception that there are
anything but random stranger relations, and that there could certainly
be no social obligations generated, by unexpected proximities. In
smaller towns, or in towns where there are people who think they control
the influx of people, this perception about the obligations that exist
changes. However, it does not legally change. I think it creates
additional risk that the law would be utilized to control, and lies and
adverse socialization would arise, to impose obligations on people who
do not actually have any obligations. An excellent example of this would
relate to minorities who want to spend more time in white environments,
but don’t want to be socially inviting or solicitous. Any rejection of
niceties can pose a risk, particularly I think, of lies and complaints
of controlling women.</p>
<p>There is a strange view in the United States in certain locations
that “watches” and “anonymous reports” of “suspicious behavior” is
reasonable. However, such views about reporting have no relationship to
the law, and anyone in the public who thinks they can make anonymous
reports, and complaints, or non-anonymous reports and complaints,
without any expertise (or even with expertise), is a threat to people
who simply exist in proximity to where they happen to go. An implication
of this is that minorities and people who are not especially inviting
socially, can be targeted as unwanted people, and without legal
justification. Without expertise, and legal justification, people are
prone to exaggeration and bolstering of claims. A claim, once falsely
made, is something that may be defended for many years, without
justification. Someone who simply claims that someone is behaving in a
way that is suspicious or unwanted can be expected to defend that claim
zealously. In this way, social obligations about basic appearances and
behaviors can be imposed on people who are behaving entirely
reasonably.</p>
<p>My behavior and appearance is typically well within the expectations
of people who are in culturally dominating groups, because I am dominant
within the culture myself; but also, more importantly, I was raised as a
white child in an environment that was well-off, and formal. However,
not wanting to permanently behave formally and in a solicitous and
inviting way to others, particularly since now I’m more well known and
want to preserve my own solitary use of time even in public spaces, I
have departed from being as humble, and eager to please, and have become
more interested in appearing to want to be left alone.</p>
<p>Since I spend a considerable amount of time in public spaces, where
people definitely appear regularly, and am well-known, but want to be
left alone, I am definitely targeted by others who think they have
knowledge or proximity that justifies the imposition of social
obligations. Since my perspective is that I have no such social
obligations, and will certainly not act as though I do, there is a clash
in social interests, that are not legal in nature. There is a risk
however, that someone will try to make them legal. In fact they
have.</p>
<p>“Acknowledge me” appears to be a basic area in which risk is
generated. If a person is not acknowledged, they do appear to believe
they are justified in creating hostilities.</p>
<p>Recently, after having a period of camping with my mobile Van which
is like an RV, I was in need of washing clothes. That is an activity I
enjoy at laundromats despite the side-effect of having to cross paths
with unwanted individuals. Shortly after walking into this laundromat, a
man who seemed to be very strange said “hello” to me, wanting to create
conversation. Not wanting to have any conversation, and not even wanting
to be near him, I simply did not say anything. I simply resumed my
behavior, gently (not that it needs to be gently), getting some coins
from a dispenser that converts dollars to change. This person became
fairly irate, and began cursing at me, saying “If you can’t say hell,
well then, Fuck you!” I just ignored him, but this is an unwanted
interaction in which a random stranger tried to impose on me an
obligation of being socially inviting. This sort of situation is one
that could invoke legal actions, but those legal actions would have had
nothing at all to do with any legal obligations. If he became more irate
he could have easily called the police, had someone else call the
police, and lie about an occurrence. However, all would have been due to
an unreasonable belief about social obligations and relationships which
did not exist at all. Thinking about how Black Americans must have lived
historically, I am certain they would have been jailed and killed simply
for having people prompt authorities without justification. The
motivation for creating a legal situation is unrelated to the veracity
that such a legal situation existed.</p>
<p>Typically I do not spend time at laundromats, and these days I intend
to restrict myself again to more affluent areas, except as required by
transit which may take me through less desirable parts of town, and
locations. Being mainly in nicer neighborhoods, and libraries, and
gymnasiums athletic clubs, the people who would create some risk would
be those who would be less low in social class, but riskier because of
their readiness to prompt legal support to their own tastes, outside of
what is called for by the law. In other words, white women and men, who
think they deserve ingratiating behavior and acknowledgement. Being
myself well accomplished and through my career, this is especially
annoying. I find myself wanting to be more like an old man who simply
doesn’t do any of those things any longer. This may require that I dress
more like an old man, and perhaps act more like an old man in various
ways. Either way, I still face risks related to co-use of public or
social spaces, in which people know certain things about me, or think
they do, and believe this then necessitates talking and smiles. I also
face risks of coming in close proximity to people who again, want me to
be socially inviting simply because we see each other. I am not exactly
sure how I will address this strategically, but I will not be at all
ingratiating and will resume my classification of these people as
strangers and randoms.</p>
<p>Speaking of this reminded me of birds who have their handlers place
tiny masks over their eyes, so that they calm, being unable to see
anyone nearby any longer. Perhaps I will have to ask people to place on
masks and wear earplugs in any situation in which they believe they can
be socially-demanding.</p>

<h2 id="no-legacy">No Legacy</h2>
<p><em>Monday, August 1<sup>st</sup>, 2022, at 6:48 PM Alaska
Time</em></p>
<p>From a very young age I was committed to the idea of not having any
children at all. There were many considerations involved in this
decision related to observations and expectations about life during
parenting, and time commitments for children. I will discuss those
considerations another time, but for now want to discuss more thoroughly
one contributing set of reasons, which relate to the falseness of
legacy.</p>
<p>I was raised somewhat disconnectedly from a rather large family, of
15 combined parents and aunts/uncles. My mother had 6 siblings, and my
father had 7. Our grandparents, of course, had their own siblings, but
none of them were known to me. All of my grandparents are now deceased,
but while living, already there were many grandchildren and some great
grand children.</p>
<p>My mother’s family, and my fathers family were quite disconnected and
separate, as I would think very common. I spent very little time with my
mother’s family, and it was very large taken in total. I spent
considerably more time as a young child up to pre-teen years with my
father’s side of the family, which was also quite large. Even within my
father’s side of the family, there were already divides.</p>
<p>My observation when young basically amounts to a simple observation,
which is that a family quickly grows into a large hoard of people who no
longer know each other well. They become geographically separated, marry
into other families, and become disintereste in each other until they
have no knowledge of each other at all. After a short time, less than
100 years, one would have to research to even be aware that certain
family members exist at all, and after several hundred years, it is as
though there is nothing at all bringing them together under one
grand-parental node or another.</p>
<p>Taking a group of related individuals in a family tree spanning
backwards about 5 generations, one would no longer be able to credit
earlier mating pairs with any thoughts of the latest generations. They
may not speak the same language or have the same nationality. It is
really as though a large group of separate strangers was created, with
clusters of people who still think that legacy is meaningful, but have
no knowledge at all of the legacy wanted by their grandparents or people
5 generations backwards. Moreover, youths very often want to separate
from the views of their parents, and do something of significance for
themselves, to their own merits. Confusedly, however, these people think
their children will inherit their legacies, and use fantastic visions of
their own posssible family futures to justify having children.</p>
<p>On several occasions I have spoken with my male friends about
prospects of having children. Already as teens, friends were thinking
about whether or not they would have children and what it would mean. I
do not well recall those conversations but do know I had them myself,
and enivisioned what it would be like to be a parent with a number of
friends. Later, the conversations changed character. I noticed my male
friends seemed to inherit a view about creating legacy, and wanted to
justify some desire to have children. Each time hearing friends tell me
about their want of children for legacy, it seemed very selfish. They
appeared to think it was selfish themselves.</p>
<p>Elsewhere I’ve written that the desire to have kids, seems, in
retrospect, a kind of intelligence test. A mark of foolishness. People
have very little knowledge about what their children will be like, look
like, want to do, and decide for themselves. It is purely imaginative
what people think their lives will be like as parents. Not knowing this
in advance is something quite pathetic in my view. If teenagers were
asked to draw their potential families and describe what their children
will be like as adults, it would be laughable later. There would be no
resemblance.</p>
<p>Since there would be no resemblance, what is this legacy idea
exactly?</p>
<p>Additionally, there is this confusing traditional perspective in the
West that success in the world ought to be the result of merits. People
who start out with inheritance or large amounts of money from parents
seem later to need to make persuasive efforts at convincin others that
their success really was theirs. In other words, they have to try to
appear that they <em>did not</em> have a legacy from their parents even
while they are living. Conversely, there are people who have very little
while young, and probably want to escape any idea that they have a
negative legacy of sorts, of being “born into a poor or bad family
heritage”. On the extreme in the other direction, there is agreement
again, that legacy is not wanted. Instead, coming from a poor heritage,
however, people can argue more effectively that they really didn’t have
much to start with, and that their success, which is a rarity coming
from their upbringing, is really their own, and from their own work.
That is if they are not self-satisfied with less, feeling like it was of
their own effort to be only modestly successful, which is still quite
pleasant. Some with inheritance cannot maintain their own position in
life and have to think about the fact that they supposedly received
legacy and had demerits moving them in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>Oddly all above are dumb, in that they still fall for the same
ridiculous ideas about legacy in the planning of their own families, and
thinking that, their justified merits will be carried along somehow by
their children. But it was seen already above, that the most prodigious
families will later be the most numerous separate families all wanting
their own legacies?</p>
<p>Strangely, in a culture that believes in equality, and wants more
equality, is willing to completely disregard legacy, and inheritance
from their politics. In my opinion inheritance and legacy in wealth is
really abhorrent. I myself do not believe in equality, but do want
people to be well cared for, and really have their merits be recognized.
It appears that merits would be more easily recognized, if all are
initially cared for collectively, and can each argue that all starting
points were more similar than they ever were before, in a tradition of
legacy and inheritance. If inheritance were eliminated, wealth in newer
generations would be totally of collective distribution. The means of
distribution can be considered carefully, and I’m not recommending
anything in particular here, because this conversation is about my own
relationship planning. Here I will ask the reader to notice, that the
benefits of our cultures and our nations do seem quite connected with
shared possessions and organizations, which do not seem very well
organized, but nevertheless provide very good benefits. Public
libraries, museums, schools, and state colleges, and various subsidized
resources, and welfaristic programs do quite a lot to benefit everyone.
I think Parks have been a very massive benefit to my life, and that is a
collective inheritance that has very little to do with private
wealth.</p>
<p>In my life, I prefer not to have children for many reasons, but one
of those reasons is definitely about the falsity of legacy, and the
other is about the inability to really plan the characteristics of that
my family would have. I’m not going to pretend that my visions would be
a reality.</p>
<p>Additionally, not having a legacy means I am not deluded about my own
productions and their value. I have a more clear idea about my
contributions. My contributions are more clearly connected with a sane
political view. I can really reject inheritance (and I’ve done so
legally already, sending documents to my parents that I do not want any
money every and no inheritance of any kind from them). By doing this, I
am doing something that matches my ethical worldview. I will not, like
them, be providing an inheritance (although they might to their other
children). My money, if there is any remaining at my death, would be
recycled into the public funds somehow. These public funds would be
distributed into various programs, and probably poorly. However, people
who receive them will receive them from the public, and from at least
one person who does not conceive their benefits to arrive from someone
who thinks they owe them something in return. Their merits really will
be even closer to their own.</p>
<p>Additionally, there is negative legacy that is actual and not usually
considered as such. Creation of children is the primary way that waste
and pollution and destruction to the environment occurs. Imagine having
a family of 8 children like my grandparents on my fathers side. In a few
generations, they may have produced a thousand or more offspring. While
their offspring would have completely forgotten their wordlview, and
maybe shunned it, there are the real physical ramifications of having
many homes, many vehicles, and much trash created. The measure of
destructiveness of people is related to the existence of people and
their numbers. Disgustingly, people will claim they have a positive
legacy, and then act as though their mating practices have not decided
the path of destruction ahead. If someone has no children at all, they
really can do nearly anything they wish burning fuels for energy,
building homes, and creating waste and pollution. They will never
produce as much pollution as a family with a single child would.</p>
<p>In my life I spent far too much time being extremely economical and
careful about waste, with the definite exception of the burning of fuels
for my extensive travels (even though I was also a bicycle commuter to
in part to reduce consumption that would be used with regular vehicular
commutes, to and from work and other locations). Nowadays, however, I
have very little concern. Not only do these families that will create
large populations of people not concern themselves with waste of their
children, they seem very little concerned in reality and in practice to
do anything useful to make themselves more efficient. My efficient times
have been a great contrast with the normal parent who thinks themselves
economical at all.</p>
<p>I will also not be having children for these reasons provided above.
It is freeing to remove responsibility from myself for destrution to the
environment, while simultaneously making my life easier, by being able
to be mostly unconcerned with waste and energy efficiency. I also don’t
have to pretend that any measures I could take would be effective.
Having taken those measures, I know them to be postures, and socially
recommended ways at failingto be economical. It is becoming a part of a
poorly devised plan that does not really exist in an efficient form.</p>
<p>By not having children, one can be</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>vastly less destructive, and</li>
<li>more honest</li>
<li>less deluded about legacy</li>
<li>more consistent in politics</li>
</ol>
<p>Inheritance is something that is very poorly considered in politics.
It is a sad oversight. Elimination of this part of legacy, people would
have more resources who need them. It would make discussions about
minimum wages and the like easier. Social programs would be more readily
funded. Conversations about the benefits and priveleges of wealth would
be much less interesting. People wouldn’t be born into riches in the
same way as they are now, as funds are shifed from the private sphere to
collective wealth.</p>
<p>Relating this conversation to my personal form, and my plans for
relationships, it is clear then that I have no interest in, and have not
had interest in, tracking anything related to kids. If I were to become
a teacher again, I would include youths potentially in my relationship
plans, however that is a risky thing to me too, for completely different
reasons relating to risks of false accusations and forms of personal
degeneration (Parenting is fundamentally connected to molestation and
pedophilia, and being too close to kids creates risks of becoming
parent-like).</p>
<p>The primary way that children figure into my plans is that I intend
to avoid them entirely, except to see them in public on occasion, which
makes one feel more close to civilization, and a normal social life. I
accept them in entertainment, and on social media, to an extent, because
of their liveliness and ability to create fun and excitement. It could
be that I would prefer youthful television to the television of older
generations, except where it would be informative or on nature.</p>
<p>Legacy is not something I’m working on for myself via a family. I
have mentioned that I would like my views on ethics to have some
influence, while recognizing, as I’ve stated elsewhere, that most
writing is for the self, and a few interested readers at most. It is too
rare that a large number of people would read someone’s writing, and
most of my writing is inaccessible anyhow, because of a big contrast
between ordinary traditional viewpoints and my own. I do prefer to have
an audience to my ideas, and that some influence occurs confirming my
ideas. However, even those cannot last many thousands of years in the
future, or millions of years, in a way that would trace to my knowable
persona. Having had influence is not really a legacy either, if nobody
knows at all who it came from. I still, however, would like to benefit
society even if I am not knowable, and my name is never mentioned. This
appears also to be view starkly different from one supporting and
believing in legacy.</p>
<p>An additional concluding remark comes to mind though. One mission of
this work is to find a way to have lasting recordings from human beings.
Some approach to making one’s thoughts and one’s autobiography, and
images and media something that can be archived and continue to exist
into the distant future. This means I am actualy working on something
that would make legacy more realizable, but only in the sense that not
everything that one has created, and not all that was written about
one’s life vanishes too quickly. If I am able to create a system such
that a few million people are able to archive their information for a
few thousand years, then I would have contributed something to legacy.
However, I still recall, even while working on such efforts, that people
need to be interested enought to look at something again later, and if
everyone had everything recorded, nobody would likely look at anyone in
particular, unless they were really interesting. Supposing one trillion
people were archived, a reading of one of those one trillion would have
a probability potentially, of one in one trillion, or less. This means
that information would die in a similar way gradually like human life,
and become completely unusable and inaccessible, like dissolving
fossils. However, it means along the way there are many uses unlocked
regarding that information, and it is very pleasant to think that one
can really leave after death, many artifacts indicating truths about
one’s life. This may not be available for an extremely long time, or
with great interest for long, but it will exist. In this way, it isn’t
unlike a book placed in a library. Most books in libraries are never
read or picked up. Some may have negative value, though. So there is the
possibility, that the existence of a life story will be of negative
value too, than positive. However, that is an unknown and relates to
problems of interest to solve.</p>
<p>It would be very useful if we determined that a complete history of
one’s life is not worth creating, or know very specifically when that
would be. Becasue then, one might put no effort into that and enjoy
other things instead.</p>

<h2 id="filtration-and-imagination-or-higher-order-attention">Filtration
and Imagination, or Higher Order Attention</h2>
<p>Earlier I wrote a small booklet by hand on an initial strategy for
managing attention, for the purpose of ensuring that one’s life is more
risk free, and more inclusive of what is needed to satisfy curiosities
and create good quality knowledge:</p>
<p><a
href="imagination-and-filtration-dark-green-notebook.html">Imagination
and Filtration, the Dark Green Notebook</a></p>
<p>This notebook has been transcribed into type but needs editing to its
more complete version.</p>
<p>Here it is included for the reason of attaching it to the strategy
which is used for personal data collection, and reminders about various
prioritized categories of life which relate to planning, and
self-reminding. The work on the other small book <a
href="rational-times.html">Rational Times</a> had the purpose of
recording for myself, in better mental moments, what might be used as a
guide when remembered at other times in my life. The Parsonal Form and
Life Categories/Priorities, was to proide a basic technological
mechanism for self-training on the basis of what was considered in more
rational moments. The idea is that people have times in which they are
really more rational about their own behavior. They are free of certain
compulsions and desires that activate unwanted habits. Training is
required to undo those habits or replace them with alternative habits.
These two works put these two parts together, and for several years I
actively trained and recorded data on my own behavior and life and
connected those behaviors with my thoughts I had in more rational
moments.</p>
<p>Higher Order Attention and Imagination and Filtration, is a more
detailed treatment of life-design that pertains particularly well to
relationships, because relationships are the sources of both risks we
want to avoid and stimulation we want to receive. In my life I had
contrary inclinations to live in nature, away from people, in an
aesthetic context, detached from people and away from the risks they
create; and to be in an environment that is sufficiently rich, and
probably urban, to have access to places which provided new and
interesting things to learn, and people to observe and have near. People
provide stimulation in the sense that they create culture, and the best
parts of culture have investments which connect with urban living. Also
people provide stimulation because they are living and without them what
would remain is culture without living examples. People also want to be
near people. It is strange to be away from people for too long.
Stimulation from people provide little things that are not well
understood about what we want in our learning experiences, which include
most experiences.</p>
