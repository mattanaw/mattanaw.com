<h2 id="introduction"><a name="introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>This paper examines the concept of cult to determine if it creates
any risks, and it is found that alternative methods of communication are
less harmful, and more objective or scientific. A topic of interest is
developed, concerning innocuous or necessary human activities which
approach behaviors that are proto-cult behaviors, or cult-like
behaviors, that also explain what might be considered beneficial in
cults. It is explored whether the concept of cult is too biased in its
intended uses, to separate out groups fornegative judgement, with
insufficient consideration whether the characteristics defining cults
would be more generally inclusive of groups that people find themselves
in, that might not be considered harmful already, or might have positive
traits. It is also consdered whether or not the concept of cult is
artificially exclusive. A primary finding of this paper is that basic
human activities already include characteristics that trend towards
cult-like organization, and that interesting aspects of psychology and
group definition and membership that relate to cults, also relate to
most other kinds of group membership.</p>
<h2 id="bias-in-the-word-cult"><a name="bias-in-the-word-cult">Bias in
the word ‘Cult’</a></h2>
<p>Usage of the word ‘cult’ seems oftentimes, if not always, assumptions
about what is to be avoided in human behavior. A group, and its
adherents, are considered cultlike once a judgement has been formed that
the behaviors that they are involved in have characteristics that should
motivate others to work towards elimination. Because there are other
ways to speak concerning groups, and members of groups, and its benefits
and detriments, that does not include assumptions about whether it
should or should not exist, it seems these should be preferred. One
needs a way to talk about cult-like groups to determine first if they
are indeed cult like, and the language utilized for such a purpose
should be more scientific and objective, and less concerned with what
might really be a final judgement about its value.</p>
<p>If we are to consider a groups history, from its initial formation
with its founder or founders, through its collection of membership, to
the end of its existence as a separate group, we can easily discuss its
properties, and easily describe objectively actions in the group, and
beliefs of members, and lives of members, without relying on anything
that immediately considers it negative in total. Simple language also
seems to supply what is needed to describe its history. A history of a
smaller group than a nation, could permit of the same level of
objectivity as a national history would. One could simply describe the
history of the group as completely as possible, and arrive at a
scientific case study of that group. Consideration of whether or not the
group is harmful enough to require outside judgement and outside action,
to dismantle it, or otherwise diminish it, is not something that would
be part of the study. At most it would be something that would arise
after such a study is conducted.</p>
<p>Motivations for a study on certain groups may be due to perceptions
that actions in the group or the group are especially harmful, but also,
that they might be especially beneficial. It is important one way or
another, that the work conducted to provide an understanding of a group
be one that is objective and separates these motivations from the task
of getting details accurate. This is what a scientist is required to do,
and this is also what a historian strives to achieve. Motivations for
conducting the work certainly tend to involve emotional interests, or
interests related to error detection, or desire to fix circumstances;
but historical training and scientific training both <em>require</em>
objectivity. Complete objectivity is not attained but if one is not at
all working towards objectivity, or is showing signs in the course of
work, and at the outset, of strong bias, then one is not doing what one
is trained to do. It appears the use of the word ‘cult’ is a strong
indicator the the thinker who is examining the group is already finished
with their judgements about whether the group should be diminished or
dismantled by force from the outside. This is certainly not a scientific
way of examining human behaviors.</p>
<p>The word ‘cult’ does not appear to have an origin that is entirely
systematic. Instead, we have arrived at growth of the word by
asysatematic usage; and it must be admitted that this usage does include
negative connotations. If one creates a group with a certain mission,
one does not want immediately to be considered a cult for this reason.
If one’s group were classified as a cult, one could expect actions from
outside to diminish or dismantle the work performed to create the group.
The word ‘cult’ also defies definition. A work called ‘Cults in America’
works to provide a definition of cult that is a candidate for
acceptance, but it appears this definition is intended not to really
scientifically define systematically on natural categorizations of group
formations and human behaviors (i.e. a taxonomy of natural groups), but
instead looks for ingredients that appear common to groups that are
predetermined to be negative. It is here suggested, that groups and
individual behaviors figure into the natural world, and if we are to
unobjectively understand groups, in a systematic fashion, classification
would not be done to simply aggregate groups together that are already
in mind, but instead to represent the structure of the world apart from
benefits and detriments.</p>
<p>An unfortunate issue with words is that once included in a dictionary
they can be expected to be used. A dictionary advertises to an extent
words which can be used. Dictionaries do not provide any system of rank
for value of terms, with the effect that certain words will again appear
in culture because some individual or group located and began touse the
word again. Many examples of words exist that should have been
discontinued. ‘Phlogiston’ is such an example. It is arguable that the
word ‘cult’ is one that is better avoided. However, it is not in the
power of the current author to train or teach others that the word
should be avoided, and that it should eventually be devalued within
dictionaries. The author thinks it necessary to understand works which
exist, and for that purpose, it is necessary to know what the letters
‘c’‘u’‘l’ and ‘t’ jointly mean. But it is the authors strong suspicion
that this word is connected with motives for eliminating groups that are
unwanted, and for controlling the growth of groups which may simply be
competitors.</p>
<p>Another bias in the word cult and its development and current
application, is that it is not as inclusive as one might think it should
be. In my estimation, many large religious groups really do qualify for
the designation, and so do some entire nations; however, artificially
groups that one is a member of already, or groups that are well
established, are not designated. Instead, groups that are immediately
considered unwanted, or are competitive with religion, or are different
and misunderstood, for having no history or case study, are lumped in as
‘cults’. A better system of group classification would be more inclusive
and more descriptive about details of the nature of human aggregates,
and would include groups that are both considered positive and negative
in traits. Consider that in the system of animal taxonomy, whether a
particular animal is harmful or not, or beneficial or not, is not the
method of classification. Instead, an animal that has natural traits
representing some structure in the Earth’s history that permit its
placement in the taxonomy, and that animal might have unexpected traits
that are positive, negative, or neutral, depending on the person
examining it. Likewise, proper group classifications would not be a
dumping ground for groups based on individual judgement. Instead, they
would be expected to have positive and negative traits, and even if
negative, would not instantly be candidates for elimination.</p>
<p>Another approach to the determination of whether groups are
especially harmful could simply involve checklists around symptoms,
which can be used after careful and accurate case studies and histories
are performed. In this way, determination about the harmfulness of a
group is really about measuring characteristics in a way this is similar
to medical practices. It appears to me that using the word ‘cult’ for
this purpose is not really feasible, for it hasn’t been determined if
certain cults are not beneficial. Instead, a way of measuring a groups
strengths and weaknesses, and harmfulness is necessary, and the result
would be far more interesting and diagnostic than simply applying a term
with a judgement, having no diagnostic method at all to use.</p>
<h2 id="who-joins-groups"><a name="who-joins-groups">Who Joins
Groups?</a></h2>
<p>A friend recently shared some comments and observations about the
susceptibility of people to different kinds of cults. This has
stimulated the author’s interest in revisiting this topic, and upon
reflection, it appears to me that cult-membership susceptibility relates
to more basic interests in information and knowledge that is highly
desired, and creation of social relationships which are satisfying.
These behaviors are, in the author’s opinion, not only related to cults
but to much of human behavior, including group formation and group
joining. This means we can understand perhaps better, the inclination to
join groups which others might think are cults, because this activity of
joining is related to any group that can be joined, and not only one
kind of group. Similarly, it also relates to basic human desires for
social companionship that seems meaningful, and desire for knowledge
that one cannot have alone.</p>
<p>In order to understand who joins groups, one has to consider when
groups can be joined, and how people come into contact with them. One
cannot join a cult if one does not know it exists, which means that
exposure is a necessary ingredient in group membership. In order to join
a cult in the state of Iowa, for example, one would have to be exposed o
it in Iowa, or else be exposed in another way through some
communication. This simply means one has to be able to connect a person
to a group, spatially and in time, to have any relationship at all that
can be called membership. This is very similar to a business and
customer relationship. A customer of a restaurant in Iowa cannot exist
until someone is in Iowa, and is exposed to the restaurant, and then
goes into the restaurant.</p>
<p>People who join groups also somehow end up becoming aware of them.
The exposure includes becoming attentive to their existance. The author
resides part time in the State of Alaska. There are many businesses in
Alaska, so of course, it is not realistic to think that he will be a
customer to all these businesses, or be aware of them all. He can easily
learn of new businesses, by being exposed, or becoming attentive out of
some learning. Exposure creates attention, or attention exists and then
one gets directly exposed.</p>
<p>People who are more knowledgeable about cults understand that there
is more than one type. Striving to understand certain harmful groups, it
is recognized that certain groups having unwanted characteristics exist
in different market industries. There are churches, clubs, businesses,
political groups, military groups, race promoting groups, and other
types of groups which are cult-like. One can join a business and find
that it really is similar to a religious cult in a number of ways, and
that strict adherence to its rules and values are required and are not
optional, and that one must try to believe in a product or company
mission even if it is false. Knowing that businesses are quite diverse,
it is clear that there is a very large number of groups which could have
cult-like qualities. Group forms that have any type of formalization, or
structure, tend to resemble corporate forms and are even modeled on
corporate forms. Groups themselves relying on structures learned from
other types of groups which might be cults, might also have the
characteristics of cults. It is not clear what category of human groups
classification would be immune from having cult-like qualities, and it
is in the authors opinion that it is better simply to drop the word
‘cult’ and simply attend to human behavior in joining and group
structures, and group benefits and detriments, related to their
properties. The point here though, is that groups themselves are the
subject of interest, and that many group types have those qualities that
might be considered cult like, if examined objectively. We can expect
that this would be the case because of the number of types of cults that
have already been identified that exist in, apparently, each of the
major ways of organizing people.</p>
<p>Because there are diverse group types, there are diverse reasons to
join groups. Here we will need to be a bit narrower in order to focus
attention on groups which the reader can be expected to relate to cults
that have existed. To do this, let’s think of groups for now that are
outside of work. These are groups one would join in leisure time to
satisfy interests that are not necessarily money-related. One joins with
a zealous political group, or religious group, or race-promoting club
outside of work. It is interesting to consider that these groups may
have very compelling reasons for joining, because livelihood itself, via
acquisition of necessary funds for living, are not involved. What is
desired in this kind of context would be more closely related to those
two key drivers to group joining I have indicated:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The desire to have valuable information</li>
<li>The desire to have social relations that feel meaningful</li>
</ol>
<p>Having social relationships that relate to valuable information that
is agreed upon seems very fundamental to human group membership. It
appears that people who are married come to agree on much, and may not
be satisfying at all, without agreement on many areas of life. Families
can be expected to vote similarly on politics. People enjoy being
together if they feel they have similar views, and perhaps uniqueness in
relation to the value of the information and knowledge had.</p>
<p>Some will join groups because they were invited. In that case, some
other human characteristics about sociability are the initiating factors
in group membership. If this is how a group is joined, sometimes coming
to find information valuable, and agreeing with other group members
about the value of information comes later. This is familiar because
even in marraige, information agreement can come after certai sexual
advances and sexual behaviors, and other behaviors relating to mating
and courtship, and not complete agreement of minds. Over time, there is
a trend, probably related to social pressures, for married parties to
express shared views on many aspects of life, which clearly indicates
that marriage groups are initiated for social reasons, sexual in nature
first, and then agreement about information and valuation of that
information comes later. In any case, something satisfying socially was
involved and it is considered meaningful.</p>
<p>Others will join groups after they are exposed and realize that it
fulfills an information related need, that is not fulfilled in a
solitary way, and may include a way to fulfill social needs
additionally. One might join this type of group to learn more, and do so
independently at first. One might find that the information is really
agreeable to certain interests which existed. Perhaps one studied
religion, and without finding satisfaction with the information alone,
sees new information that seems powerful and improved, with some
authority. Scarcity of information and ability to develop religious
information alone is changed suddently to what feels like a large and
abundant amount of information that feels like it has authority and
value. One can come to feel that one is depenant on this new abundance
of information that could not be created or developed in a solitary way.
This explains two types of phenomena: firstly, when one finds a group
that has a very well developed culture that one feels one belongs in
immediately, because of existing interests; and secondly, the meeting of
powerful minds that seem already to have high development and extreme
abundance of guidance and teaching. Anyone who has experienced a really
good teacher in school, or in college, will recall the feeling of having
something very valuable suddenly, that permits growth, where one was
already interested. One perceives one could not necessarily come to the
same information withoutsolitary effort that is too great, or very
difficult.</p>
<p>The reader can likely find a number of groups that they have joined
or know someone has joined that has either succeeded in providing these
benefits, or have tried to.</p>
<p>The author has considered that, additionally, the causes of group
membership can happen before one is even with other people. These
situations can be cult-like as well. Suppose one is intensely interested
in a particular topic, and spends time talking with friends and family
regarding that topic. Suppose when alone, one thinks about that topic
often. Then suddenly, one becomes aware of some documentaries about that
topic, or a book on that topic, that suddenly “provides a new world of
information”. Maybe a field exists that one did not know about, or a
group or school of thought, that various people have already contributed
writings for. The reading of a book, or watching of films, can have a
very powerful influence, which also relate to the two above factors.
Firstly one is suddenly aware that there are others with the same
interest, and that they have valuable information that one cannot simply
create on one’s own. It makes things more clear. Secondly, since others
are involved, there is a social component that is pleasing, even if one
has not actually had conversation with anyone in person, or in a group
setting. One feels quickly that one is a part of something that is
happening that is alive and matters.</p>
<p>An implication of this is that it may be possible, under another
system of group naming and taxonomy, to understand that this is a very
early form of group membership, in one person, which would have
positives and negatives, benefits and detriments, strengths and
weaknesses, in properties that can be examined and measured.
Furthermore, it seems to imply that harmful cases would exist that would
be desirable to avoid, and that some of these harmful cases would be
forms of cult-like grouping at the individual level. This may exist, for
example, if a person who is white, who is a very harmful environment,
who is really targeted by groups of people who are clearly of other
races, on grounds of race hatred, who suddenly becomes aware that there
are people who have thought through what he/she is thinking through in
struggles. In that case, the person may not have actually joined any
group, but has benefitted from information that strengthened them in
some ways, by confirming information, and providing some guidance.
However, this too would be a case of postives and negatives, strengths
and weaknesses, benefits and detriments, and it may be that for one
individual, they are in a cult-like membership situation, alone.
Gradually, here, however, I will start to refrain more from using the
word cult. Because what is plain is that some groups that resolve this
persons issue may be much more positive than others, some might be
positive enough, with so few negatives, that it is not really worth
eliminating, or passing a social judgement on that implies it is totally
wrong. Or, conversely, it can have many harms, but these harms can be
understood without using the term ‘cult’. Better still, any group of any
kind, cult or not, can be understood as something to prserve and keep,
or to diminish, on the basis of measured properties which might be
harmful or not. If this person is not only receiving strength and true
information for overcoming race hatred, but goes much further on other
pathways to false scientific views, pseudoscience, and organized crime,
then it is something to perhaps discontinue. Either way, one wants to
know what is really going on, have a case study created without in-built
terms of judgement.</p>
<p>Seeing that it is possible then to have a feeling of joining and
belonging a group on one’s own, by simply having access to written
information, or entertainment, it seems possible that very harmful group
membership can exist in individuals alone. The type of group membership
that an individual can exist in in a solitary way is also quite large
and can be classified many ways. The example above was about racial
information and safety. It depends on the interests of the person who
‘joins’, and what they are exposed to. A person could be in a business
type of cult, by simply becoming a remote employee without having much
human contact at all. A person can also become a self-proclaimed member
of an economic-political organization, that might be harmful, simply by
reading about it. Without doing any mesurement, or consideration of the
specifics of each group and person involved, at the individual level to
the large-scale level, one does not really know what the harms and
benefits are. One has to look more closely at the specific details to
determine which situation is worth developing and which is not, and when
interferrence from outside is justified.</p>
<p>Another thing that is of interest for this topic is the freedom of
individuals, and of their freedoms of being able to join groups.
Politically in various countries certain freedoms are supposedly
provided or protected in writing, for people to be able to explore the
world of information and join groups as they decide, to their liking.
However, there is also the consideration of what feels most comfortable
to a human animal. It is clear that these activities of finding useful
information for learning, and joining groups for social reasons really
do require autonomy for each person, and that this cannot simply be
interferred with by anyone for any reason. Another issue with the word
‘cult’ is that one may find a group and not adhere in negative ways, and
extract many benefits. They also know what they require and others do
not. Without measuring individuals or groups for harms and benefits in a
truthful way, it is hard to know when interferrence makes sense. It’s
not totally clear who can and should be able to interfere. But the world
cult immediately seems to create some feeling that interferrence is
good, and that any interferrence may be overlooked. However, from this
examination, it seems more clear that one has to look more closely at
individuals, and group classificaitons, and how people join groups, and
what the groups really do over time, to know if they are sufficiently
harmful to require some kind of interferrence. That would be done in a
way that includes knowledge about the situation and not immediate
judgement.</p>
<p>From the above it can be seen that a science of individual search for
information and group membership can be achieved and this would result
in a superior approach to understanding group harms and benefits, and
for determining scientifically what might be better avoiding and
promoting, and how various natrual comforts and freedoms relate.</p>
<h2 id="harmful-groups"><a name="harmful-groups">Harmful Groups</a></h2>
<p>The author would want to explore in detail any group that is
considered to be harmful, in a way that is objective, at first removing
any assumption that it is harmful at all, in a total sense. Instead, it
would be looked at in all details that relate and are important and
relevant. Later what is harmful and positive would be related to
specifics, and ideally measurable properties of the people, the group,
and behaviors/consequences. There is no objective in this, however, to
argue that there are no groups that are not so harmful that they should
not be transformed or disbanded. Instead, it is assumed that if all
groups are really inspected, many groups, of many types, not necessarily
those supposedly fulfilling loose-criteria on cultishness, would be
measured as very harmful and worth diminishing, transforming, or
eliminating. Some would be well-known and common.</p>
<p>Of particular interest to the author are organizations that are not
honest or truthful, use extensive use of propaganda, include information
control from above that is not in the interests of education and
well-being of people who are members, or who are exposed frequently.
Groups that have leadership structures that are individual or not, that
have clandestine negative interests would be potentially included among
those that are especially harmful.</p>
<p>There are assumptions that groups that were considered really harmful
had some characteristics resembling the above. That membership was
manipulated, placed in untruth, forced to receive information
unreflectively, by leadership of one person who was considered totally
necessary for certain necessary benefits. The present author would not
restrict harmful organizations to those with only one leader, that uses
force of authority to delude members, steal from them, send them to
commit violence or harms of others, or to interferrence with others who
are free to be members of other groups, or engage in behaviors
unrelated. Groups of one or more can do many different forms of harm to
others, and I would extend the harms to all actual harms, and not only
those harms that one would use to arrive at a group of cults.</p>
