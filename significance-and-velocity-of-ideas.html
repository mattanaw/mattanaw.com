<p>This essay is a response to a kind interview request from Mr. Scott
Douglas Jacobsen of Insight Journal, on various topics of interest
relating to the experiences of people of high ranging intelligence. He
has posed a number of questions that are of good interest to the high
intelligence community, and others who might have concerns about the
credibility of certain intelligent figures, historical and current.
Seeing relationships between the various questions, I have chosen,
instead of answering each individually, to provide a single combined
response, which may bring together the topics into one that will allow
for more general understanding. I have spent considerable time thinking
and rethinking this subject, believing it important particularly as it
relates to the question of cult leadership. Thinking it worthwhile to
develop the topic further, I hope there is durable interest and utility
in my responses here, which would bring value to Mr. Jacobsen’s Journal
itself. The questions themselves can be found at the end of the article.
I have included along with each question a pointer to the section in
which the question has been given treatment, as a sort of index to the
essay.</p>
<p><a name="introduction"></a></p>
<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>This article treats of the topics of how a person, including those
from the general public, can identify if another person is extremely
smart, in the higher range of intelligence, and how one can identify who
is a high intelligence charlatan; or else a high IQ person who might
pose special risks to others in the general public. There is no
assumption in this article that highly intelligent people pose special
risks which warrant negative opinions regarding unknown smart
individuals. Being able to identify the intelligence of others, relates
to how one might decide to continue to interact. It is discussed how
someone with very high intelligence might determine whether one is of
appropriate company for friendly acquaintanceship with the purpose of
mutual development, which is very different than a relationship to a
cult leader who is impressive in various ways, or someone who has
harmful intentions. A germane idea to this is the concept I created of
<em><a href="glossary.html#velocity-of-significance">velocity of
significance</a></em> which relates to measuring learning and
creativity, as it permeates conversation and productive behavior. Having
permeated behavior, it is pervasive in its effects, and can be used as a
focal point for evaluating others informally. The finding of this paper
is that two separate processes are required which relate to this
concept, and also the concept of trust. The cause of the separate
processes, which could be joined into a single process but need to be
separate within it, is that some will not have adequate psychological
tools to evaluate trustworthiness directly, talking with someone.
Others, however, who are much more equipped, including some of the
highly intelligent, can more rapidly discover probability of
trustworthiness.</p>
<p>This entire essay could potentially be summarized as an attempt at
determining how one might know or discover if someone is really smart or
not, particularly at the highest levels of intelligence. While it might
seem as though this is an easy issue, which can be solved using
standardized tests, and perhaps some appraisal of historical or
autobiographical events, this would not be adequate because it would be
incomplete. One question posed by Mr. Jacobsen that is hard to resolve
is whether one is a charlatan or not, at the highest levels of
intelligence, including founders of HighIQ groups, even if this person
apparently has made it into high IQ societies, and apparently has some
autobiographical support. It is possible to fake one’s way into the
communities, with varying difficulties depending on which and when.
Creating a HighIQ community, is easy for anyone, and may allow one to
bypass entirely the requirements that other IQ communities would have.
This is of special interest within the high IQ community which does know
that people can slip in who do not belong, even if they are very kind.
Inside and outside of the high IQ community, there are concerns about
highly intelligent people who can be special risks to others, either by
defrauding people with a false persona, or by using their intelligence
which cannot be well detected against them in ways that are malicious.
These questions are related and people really are affected, and there
are good reasons to give some answers which might be better than those
that have been provided previously. I believe I have been successful
with that in the response below, with limitations that I myself point
out.</p>
<p>Also of interest is the topic of who was smart in the past and
determining how smart they really were. Past prominent figures are of
special interest, but their prominence has detracted understanding of
who else was very intelligent, and sometimes the prominent figures do
not have any testing justifying psychometric conversations, apart from
productions they have had, that resulted in their prominence. This
question relates to an interest some in the community have, or determing
how smart their peers are and whether their peers appear to be people
worth commingling with, even if they belong to the same club which has
as its mission giving people opportunities to find people who are like
themselves.</p>
<h2 id="interview-request"><a name="interview-request">Interview
Request</a></h2>
<p><em>Scott Douglas Jacobsen:</em></p>
<p>You wrote an interesting article entitled “How Do People With IQs
Over 180 Act and Think?” (Cavanaugh, 2018). You bring forward
individuals like Richard Feynman, Bertrand Russell, Paul Cooijmans,
Grady Towers, and societies such as the Mega Society, the Giga Society,
and Mensa International. By and large, these are well-known within the
high-IQ communities, of which I sit out in the Oort Cloud with a
telescope making notes enjoying the show and sending occasional
correspondence for interviews with members of these communities. I am
not a formal member of these communities. I have contributed to
publications or had positions for which I’m grateful, but no formal
legitimate memberships because of no formal test to determine the merit
of the matter or deep abiding interest at that level, as some societies
do not require test scores, permit second test scores, or utilize,
widely, alternative tests with varying degrees of legitimacy in the
measurement of the psychological construct of g, general intelligence.
As far as I know, those societies with strict mainstream intelligence
test requirements are Mensa International and the Triple Nine Society,
especially with Mensa International having formal testing sites online
or, pre-coronavirus, invigilation stations all over the world. These are
important to consider, internationally, even sophisticated frauds exist
in the high-IQ communities with a grotesque example in the multi-level
marketer (scammer), human trafficker, and cult leader Keith Raniere with
the organization NXIVM where he was known as “Vanguard.” To a more
on-point tune and as a point of clarification to start us off here
today, with Feynman’s declared IQ of 126 (no S.D. mentioned), as stated
in the article, what is the factual status of Feynman’s declared IQ in
contrast to professional commentary or considerations of his
mathematical abilities?</p>
<p><em>Mattanaw:</em></p>
<p>These are interesting and important questions, which I will combine
together for response below, in the article, here entitled
<em>Significance and Velocity of Ideas</em>. Being somewhat sensitive
myself to risky questions, which may have alternative intentions, even
if accidentally in their wording, I had to perform some kind but
charitable deburring of the above interview request. I have translated
specific questions to my liking, in the end sections which serves as an
index, <a href="#interview-questions">Interview Questions</a>. I do
answer some questions more directly, within the article, where relevance
seems to call for invoking the question, and where earlier first
responses prepared seemed good for inclusion. I first answered all
questions before realizing I should combine them given other thoughts
and work. Overall, I think people do need a way to identify risky
people, particularly those who may become or are powerful in various
ways, including just on the individual level. I also think it’s
important, to finally put into proper perspective what we can know about
past figures, in which information is lacking. They cannot speak for
themselves but routinely are called to mind, by people who quickly
include assumptions, or false information regarding how smart they are.
Many examples exist online and in the media, about misestimation of
former figures who were prominent. I think below my article will help
regarding the topic of trust and accuracy, regarding how to know who is
intelligent, and what roughly their level of intelligence might be,
particularly while they are living, are already tested, and their
productions exist for survey and analysis. I belong to this later group,
being alive to respond here, but also for having many openly
demonstrable productions, ample open career history, and a long history
of psychometric testing, including psychologist-proctored testing, and
perhaps some self-made fame in and via the HighIQ community.</p>

<h3 id="my-intelligence"><a name="my-intelligence">My
Intelligence</a></h3>
<p><em>Some Autobiographical Notes Concerning My Testing and
Validation.</em> I was fortunate enough to be tested early in childhood
once, again in middle school, and twice as an adult, confirmed
immeasurable, with ceiling results on both the WAIS-IV and Stanford
Binet 5 (SB-V), both verbal and visuospatial. I was prompted to get
tested again as an adult, after solving the problem shared in the book
<em>Outliers</em> which supposedly tests at the maximum level using a
culture-fair matrix reasoning test item, which really is like those
provided on proctored psychometric exams. If this is included, I’ve had
5 confirmations. Having had the degree of confirmation that I’ve
received, I have a somewhat hard time imagining what the life of a
charlatan must be like, but I believe I’m uniquely situated for
identifying charlatans, and people who are really genuinely intelligent
who might have malintent in the treatment of others, who should
certainly be protected. My background also makes me uniquely ready and
already experienced in making detections, for my own safety, and for the
safety of others.</p>
<p>More details regarding my history of psychometrics, including a <a
href="bio-and-stats.html">brief bio and some personal statistics</a>
along with background information has been published in my book, <a
href="mattanaw.org">Book and Journal of Mattanaw</a>. Additionally, I
have a history of open and honest transparency and have shared extensive
<a href="open-health-mattanaw.html">information about my identity</a>
including my birth certificate, passport, other identification cards,
and health information, including fingerprints, retinas, other
psychological test results regarding personality, and blood tests. I am
a strict vegetarian, and vegan of over 20 years and have supplied this
information as verification of health effects of this lifestyle. I have
also included my pilots logbook for my training in flight, which allowed
me to gain a solo endorsement, to fly alown on my own, to continue my
flight flight training. It may be that I’ve provided more information as
to my identity than nearly anyone has, and this information was
published and available prior to considering any potentially related
questions in this interview.</p>
<p>I have also provided my <a href="resume.pdf">professional resumé</a>,
which also includes openly my psychometric details including my results
of intelligence tests. These have been shared with various customers of
mine, and prior employers, since approximately 2015. All of my customers
and earlier employers are aware of my psychometric details, and this has
influence colleagues and customers, many of whom were attentive enough
to read these details and potentially discuss them between each other.
This same information, and additional information, including Mensa ID,
Harvard ID, and other details have been published on my <a
href="http://www.linkedin.com">LinkedIn page</a> for years. I have also
published <a href="work-and-career-recommendations.html">customer
references</a> sharing openly recommendations from my customers, many of
whom are executives or upper managers and technologists of well-known
corporations or corporations serving customers everyone knows about. It
also established my work for federal and state and local governments,
and governments and organizations internally, and even includes my work
for the President and First Lady of the United States, and other public
officials. I have an open list of my <a
href="related-accomplishments.html#career-success">company’s customers
further indicating career success</a>, which is a short listat 85, but
will be extended as I recall various companies I’ve supported. I am now
retired although I own my company, Social Architects and Economists
International, in which I Preside and act as Chief Architect. I’ve been
very successful professionally and financially and am now retired, at 42
years old. These details provide ample information regarding my
combination of intelligence and level of productivity, and range of
humans skills, which have permitted me to work with various important
leaders globally. I am a continual traveler now focusing on writing and
media productions which are slowly being incorporated into my <a
href="mattanaw.org">book and journal</a> in progress. This book is built
using technology I architected and engineered myself, and have used for
many of the customers listed, and is a hybrid publication, being a
website for various devices as well.</p>
<p>My book is about a wide array of interdisciplinary topics related in
various ways to moral philosophy, ethics, the sciences, and technology.
Coverage is very wide and materials have been shared on hundreds of
occasions with the high intelligence community and my colleagues. Being
a work on moral philosophy demonstrably started in my early twenties
over 20 years ago, with handwritten archived materials provided, it
should be clear that I’m greatly interested in ethics and ethical
behavior, which is a cause of my being a vegetarian for so long, which
is only one way that I’ve infused my behavior extensively with
methodical moral processes, which have some writing concerning in <a
href="architecture.html">Architecture of Ethics</a>.</p>
<p>A question was posed by Mr. Jacobsen concerning trustworthiness of
certain figures who are also of claimed high intelligence who may have
been harmful. Others may include those with fake names and aliases. The
above information should convey that I’m very much different from anyone
who would recieve any accusations, and I’ve set myself apart by
providing detailed information regarding many aspects of my life. My
book is also my living autobiography which includes details and images
which some would consider private, like photos in a personal family
photo album, or images off of a camera phone, or private archive. All my
photos that I have in my possession excepting some few that have not
been digitized have already been provided. I actively upload photos
directly from my camera phone, making few if any deletions at all,
including private planning related information, information about
whereabouts, even where it appears to be irrelevant. All supports life
evidence supporting my autobiography. My name, Mattanaw, is my true
name. I changed my name to approximate a mononym from my old name
Christopher Matthew Cavanaugh, utilizing my existing alias and domain
name. It’s used and recognized publicly. My complete full name now, on
<a href="civil-law.html">legal documents</a>, and in my court order on
my <a href="open-health-mattanaw.html">identity page</a>, show it is
being widely utilized for legal functions, even as acting attorney. My
full name is “Mattanaw Christopher Matthew Cavanaugh Mattanaw” which
includes my older name as amiddle name, and repeats the mononym, since I
anticipated social media and various data systems require a first and
last name. One cannot easily change one’s name to a true mononym. My
passport also shows the same name, and is used for my travels. I am
originally a U.S. Citizen but I live in a number of other countries, and
think myself a proponent of global friendly citizenship.</p>
<p>The above may provide, through itself, some evidence of high range
giftedness. However, I want to provide clarity as it relates to
interview questions, particularly one interview question which relates
to my reading interests coming from the High IQ community itself. One
article from Noesis concerns experiences of those with many talents and
was written by Hank Pfeffer of the Mega Society. I was known from youth
to be talented in everything I attempted. I’m experienced in music, art,
photography, and am extremely physically fit. I excel at a wide range of
sport and games, and enjoy bodybuilding. My appearance may confuse
others as to my intellectual capabilities and age. I am univeristy
educated in a number of disciplines, which themselves do not make clear
all the interdisciplinary interrelationships with other studies which
are expansive. I write concerning the foundation of mathematics and
logic, and computing. I’m a virtuoso blind typer, and customers have
experienced this as I guided meetings and conducted interviews. Since I
was young I was an entertaining person, with good humor, and ability to
hold long focused conversations of various types, with any type of
person. I keep many of these activities current, which is a challenge
for most. There is much more I could say regarding my interests and
talents but the effect would be one related to the challenges faced by
those with very high giftedness. It is really difficult to convey who
you are and what you can do, and what your life has been comprised of,
with all its complexity.</p>

General Plausibility of Scaling Intelligence, and Our Unfortunate
Inability to Create Tests that can Rank Measure It</a>.</h4>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>From my understanding, there are very difficult norming requirements
for tests exceeding the range of the Stanford-Binet and Weschler,
meaning that a very large sample pool of test participants must make
themselves available in order to validate the test scoring, and ranking
with the general population. I don’t think this limitation has been
overcome except for some tests that are not themselves IQ tests, but
academic tests, that supposedly correlate well to IQ tests. These tests,
the academic ones, do have some credibility to me, for establishing
higher capabilities. Especially the Miller Analogies Test, although that
test is not culture-fair, and has some definite limitations for testing
people not very well exposed to culture in the English language. It
cannot be used to provide a raw IQ score, in the same way as a true IQ
test, but can be trusted to provide rank differentiation at an unheard
of level, of 8 Standard Deviations, as published by Pearson. Older
versions of the SAT have similar claim to IQ correlation at a high
range. Tests like these have significant investment behind them, and
many years of usage as standardized tests. People trust them enough to
place them on resumé’s and applications, to the effect that there is
tracing of their personal history involved, and one might argue, even
health records. There is very little risk of being seriously manipulated
by such tests that have such significant support. They’ve been adopted
by major universities that have an interest in protecting the records of
their students, and these universities would not be interested in
storing data that may involve a strong manipulative component.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The other category of tests that exist for extending the ceiling of
standardized high IQ tests, in a way that is more closely related to
standardized IQ tests, that are as a rule created by individuals, or
small groups, with special interests in creating the tests. There may be
some few researchers in the sciences wanting to extend research, but
these are the minority from what I see. Those named by Mr. Jacobsen may
have some credibility, as more objective individuals creating tests, but
nevertheless, there are serious flaws to these endeavors. As a rule,
they never achieve standardization or acceptance by a large body that is
willing to administer the tests separately at a cost. There is no
professional acceptance of these tests that validate their authenticity,
and no support from psychological associations that is reputation
risking. This is very different from the other tests discussed earlier,
the one’s I’ve taken, and have been exposed to, that everyone knows and
uses. This problem of having no standardization, having a lack of
norming for real rank ordering with the population, little to no
adoption, and low support from major organizations really does
completely diminish the value of these tests. It creates a health risk
to take these tests, and risk to records, and risks to one’s own
credibility, for deciding to believe results that cannot be validated,
that were created and provided by an individual with vested interests.
The individual motive of wanting to have research that has useful and
truthful results, even if the results really are not useful or truthful,
is already a known risk in the sciences. One must eventually find
support from peers and from institutions to have credibility, not only
with papers that are published resulting from research, but more
especially for anything resulting in what would require ethical
committee approval for ongoing research with human participants. In my
experience in Psychology, test designs involving human participants
require approval in advance, and disclosures need to be made to anyone
involved, including disclosures about the possible inapplicability of
results. Creating a psychological exam that will be used by people over
many years, is effectively including them in a long term
social-psychological study, and very definitely would invoke the
involvement of an ethical committee if created in a university context
before it could be administered to even volunteers. In a university
context, it may be possible to apply for and gain approval from an
ethical committee to conduct research on experimental tests, with hopes
of eventually publishing them for more general use in the larger
population. But I think those efforts would be instantly thwarted by
inability to actually get sufficient research done, because after all,
one is attempting to measure the high range. Can one even obtain
participants, at the university, using the student population, who score
at the levels that are interesting? How does one broaden such studies,
to a number of universities, to gain more participants? Now consider,
further, that one must definitely devote one’s career to make such an
enterprise successful. Has any Psychologist had success doing this, and
is there any promising research on this front, to have a test finally
standardized for this purpose?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Now consider who is creating these tests. They are not created in a
university context, with volunteers, after approvals from an ethical
committee. These test creators are operating outside of any system of
checks and balances on quality of research, and on the ethics of
continuing with a completed test!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In my experience in the high IQ societies, there are obvious damning
motives making these tests from individual creators, outside the context
of the Psychological sciences, making them mostly untrustworthy.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol type="1">
<li>There is a motivation to create and lead societies on the basis of
these tests, that are “higher societies”.</li>
<li>There is a motivation to perpetuate societies that seem to have
higher authority, and protect these already created tests that were used
for admission.</li>
<li>There is a motivation to protect one’s investment in having taken a
dubious test created by an individual.</li>
<li>There is a motivation to self-validate using these tests. Meaning
test creators use these tests on themselves to pretend they’ve been
proven they are the smartest, and that they are legitimate “leaders” of
the entire community.</li>
<li>At the very worst, there is also the motivation to provide tests
that simply inflate scores because one has not scored well on anything
else, or well enough to create self-satisfaction.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There is a very unfortunate result of these observations. The first
is that there are very incredible obstacles to overcome to arrive at a
serious test, following the steps required in the sciences, in an
academic environment. I believe individual test creators are very likely
to have research that does not lead to a completed test, allowed to be
administered at a cost, by psychologists. The second is that everyone
who is not doing this way will be unable to demonstrate that they do not
have any of the above motives. By doing it outside of the sciences one
is creating a product that definitely has not had ethical committee
backing, or peer review/support.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There are severe issues of utility around these tests:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol type="1">
<li>Very few people hit the ceiling of IQ tests and could want to take
additional tests to learn more.</li>
<li>The tests created cannot even establish a rank order, that one could
use to “finally know one’s IQ”.</li>
<li>Anyone who uses such a test to “improve their rank” has openly
exhibited self-deception, and a motive to deceive others. We have seen
that such a test could only be produced in a university setting with
huge numbers of participants.</li>
<li>The most intelligent should be the most aware of these limitations,
and yet illustrate their self-deception by trusting such tests.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The people who hope to benefit from these tests then illustrate
cognitive biases for ultimately believing the results. Notice they would
have no such error, in simply stating they do not know their IQs because
of the limitations of the trusted standard tests! No, they’ve gone
further, to trust tests their own intellects reveal to have no
rank-ordering value, and then they use it to rank themselves with it,
out of motives to increase authority and prestige.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In short:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When being untestable is not enough, we find pretend scores.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It may be that some test creators, who are researchers within the
discipline of Psychology, may have fewer motivations to do anything that
is not completely in the interests of science, and may exhibit a genuine
desire for obtaining accurate psychometrics. I also implicitly agree,
that there is a plain scaling problem in measuring intelligence, and
that since one has already scaled the difficulty of subtest scores on
standardized tests, one can obviously scale them further until a
diminishing pool of people can respond with correct answers. The problem
is one cannot rank order them in a trusted way without overcoming
difficult norming requirements, that have not been overcome. The ceiling
problem exists, because once one has gotten all answers on a test, there
is a clear feeling that one could go further. Meaning one is certainly
smarter than one has been measured to be. However, knowing that this
scaling problem exists, and knowing that there is a definite point in
which problems would be too complex for me to solve, does not imply
that, scaling it on my own, creating my own test, will reveal where
others would fail, across the ceiling, so that I can score myself and
them with a new FSIQ, higher than that provided by other tests.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The intuition that this scaling can be continued is what I think
drives some to create tests. But I don’t think they succeed, very often,
in creating good tests, and fall far short of having something even
worth attempting to norm.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Every score coming from these tests involve some commitment to a
rank-order that is not trustworthy. To take these tests and believe the
results, often coming from a single person with no training in
psychology, has a very bad effect on the test taker, who believes the
number represents a summary of their mental capacity.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“I’ve used a test created by an individual to summarize my entire
mind, or my entire cognitive ability.”</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Very little argumentation is required to demonstrate that this is a
poor idea, and yet, those who attempt to show they are the very smartest
rely on these tests. They often create and rely on these tests. Yet
anyone can take a test favorable to their strengths, and scale it
further, and pretend to have a rank score higher. They would certainly
have a rank score higher if scaled correctly, but they have no idea what
that would really be. Then they satisfy themselves with percentile
rankings with the rest of the human population. This shows a very bad
state of affairs in the highest IQ societies, that rely exclusively on
tests that were created by individuals.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>One is vastly more safe taking standardized tests with lower
ceilings, and committing to remaining content with not knowing how far
one could go beyond the ceiling. This is because there are very few bad
motives in these tests, and they are well established and standardized,
and believing one’s scores is not an act of self-deception. At the
higher ranges, it appears there is always an element of self-deception.
Again, this is what the Prometheus society seeks to avoid, by taking a
totally standardized test as its only one for admission, from academia,
the only place where the test could be normed. This is an extremely
great difference than having a society creator make a test on their
own.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>One already knows the mind is not as testable as one should like it
to be, and we already know FSIQ is not itself adequate to depict
anyone’s mind as a whole, and so why not just be happy with one’s
scores, already unobtainable to most of the population.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The reason for this is the better pool of participants who are
required to take the tests, and these tests, of course, are relied upon
by admissions at Universities, as a measure of achievement, but more
bluntly, it is intended to measure individual capacities. I believe IQ
tests would be preferred tests, for directly measuring what one wants to
know about someone, rather than indirectly, although of course, if one
performs well on these academic tests, there is additional information
about one’s cultural knowledge that is useful for determining if a
student might be successful.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This norming requirement is important enough that societies at or
above the 4SD range have to rely on either tests it has constructed, or
academic tests that seem to correlate to IQ, that have had a much larger
pool of participants for establishing reliable rank results.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To give an example, one society admitting at 4 Standard Deviations,
or FSIQ rarity of about 1/33,000, with percentile score of about
99.997%, only the Miller Analogies Test is trusted. Societies above 4
Standard Deviations, at 5 or 6 Deviations, have had to rely on
specialized tests, that have not been normed to confirm the reliability
of the rank ordering. This means these higher societies are much more
dubious in their membership claims.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I have explored the potential of taking alternative tests for getting
a more accurate prediction of my range, having the issue of not knowing
my true intelligence from attaining ceiling scores on more established
IQ tests, on portions that are both culture-fair, and portions that are
not culture-fair, that correspond directly in content to those tests
created for the highest ranges. For example, the mega test was created
by Mr. Ronald Hoefflin, with reliance on culture fair properties that
involve pattern recognition, mathematical abilities relating to
visuospatial manipulation of geometric objects and the like, areas that
I score maximally on standard IQ tests. Similarly, the Miller Analogies
Test focuses on vocabulary, which relates to a subtest, again, that I
scored maximally (untestable vocabulary). Each test resembles tests I
have scored at 99.89% on a well-normed standardized IQ test.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Folks such as myself really have no good options for establishing IQ.
We can rely on an academic test that is not culture fair like the Miller
Analogies test, or else resort to tests created by some very intelligent
members of the high IQ Societies, and some scam artists. These tests,
from my examination, having very good familiarity with reliable tests,
and university training to be a psychologist, are untrustworthy; and not
only for statistical limitations on norming, but much worse, the strong
desire of various personalities to “prove” that they are the smartest,
using alternative tests:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“I’ll create the test that says I score high, or a friend will.”</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Using these tests that allow dubious societies that exist, at a range
for which no paper test can ever be relied upon to confirm. These
societies are comprised of many who simply do not appear all that
intelligent, and seem to have found alternative methods for gaining
community access.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Entire societies and their credibility hinge on whether or not their
tests that are used for admission really do test what they claim to
test. Even societies like Mega, that draw interest and some belief in
authenticity from having interesting members, hinge on tests made by
individual people; these tests appear difficult, but the appearance of
difficultly is not enough to create a trustworthy rank ordering. Tests
created by individual people, arguably should not bear a name that
creates the impression that it is standardized, and not the creation of
one person, who again, makes the test, controls its publication, and
controls the scoring. Mega is interesting, but I don’t believe it to be
entirely authentic; and every member who was admitted using the test
provided is aware of this. Reading the publications, one finds them to
be occasionally of very high quality, but the character of the writing
is not more complex than what finds in mathematical publications. One
cannot read the journal Noesis and conclude that the test used for Mega
or the group itself is authentic.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Mega is more convincing than many other groups that exist
peripherally to the more trusted societies that are more obviously
serving people’s motives at pretense. There is an oddly huge number of
IQ societies, and most that are not well-known are obviously not
genuine. They float tests that, again, were created by individuals who
do not seem to have the experience or training to create psychological
exams. Tests come from individuals who appear to have a vested interest
in demonstrating they are the very smartest, and that the societies they
create, are authentic enough for people to join. The result however, is
that people are deceived as to their own intelligence, taking false
tests, and believe themselves to be amidst other people who are highly
intelligent. Instead, these groups are filled with a pretender support
network, where no individual appears to be authentic, and all trust,
believe-in, and rely on, tests created by random people who believe
themselves to be “genius” and the like. These groups can be quite
humorous and are obviously false, and their tests humorous as well. They
mint their own certifications with scores that are well outside of the
range of what is testable by real tests, and then they quickly
demonstrate they can hardly maintain an intellectual conversation.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I have also examined directly a test that I purchased from a
well-known, very intelligent person in the High IQ societies, who does
apparently deserve to be acknowledged for his extreme giftedness.
Examining his writings quickly reveals an unusually powerful mind. But
his tests do not seem to have the qualities necessary for confirming
other’s FSIQ scores, and has the appearance of a single man’s creation.
Having already scored maximally on similar testing, there are too many
risks to consider tests like this, that seem designed to be able to
apply a larger number.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There is risk of giving over to a random test constructor some claim
to health information. It is unusual to trust a test creator with
scoring of tests. Rather, one would expect it to be scored by trained
psychometricians/psychologists who adopted the test. One puts oneself at
some real risk taking an unstandardized test. One may receive results
that one might believe, despite their having little validity. It appears
some who have taken false tests have come to really believe their
intelligence is at the very highest range; short conversations with some
of these people instantly reveals deficiencies rather than high
giftedness.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In short, I do not believe that any test for the upper range can be
trusted, and those who reach maximum scores, like myself, have to
content themselves with having an untestable intelligence. It is my
strong recommendation that people focus on taking test batteries or
individual trusted tests, that are standardized, that might have a lower
ceiling; but a ceiling that is still high and trusted.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>One unique test that appears to be very well normed, that is used
somewhat less frequently for graduate admissions, is the Miller
Analogies Test. This is a fascinating test. Like the vocabulary subtest
of other IQ tests, it is believed to on its own provide very good
information about someone’s overall intelligence, but it is not culture
fair; instead, it is quite culture intensive; and as such, is not a very
good test for determining intelligence of those who are not well exposed
to English language cultural information. This test could not be
administered to a child, and instead could only be administered to
someone who has had exposure to a good range of subjects, that might be
covered for example Pearson textbooks, as Pearson is the creator of the
test, and appears to source its test it’s published texts with
glossaries (speculative, but reasonable). It is an analogies test,
relying heavily on vocabulary information, and ability to determine
precisely correct analogies. This skill and ability appears to be very
close to what is a foundational intellectual capacity. It tests up to 8
Standard Deviations, and is claimed to be well normed. 8 SDs is
extremely high range, to the extent that one might expect nobody to ever
attain a perfect score, or a score close to a perfect score. For a
period this is the only test that was acceptable for admissions into the
Prometheus Society, which admits at 4 Standard Deviations, or a
percentile of ~1/33,000 of the population. This society’s admissions
already have a very difficult norming problem faced, and it is
meaningful that no other test is accepted for admissions, including IQ
tests.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As the sole test accepted by this society, that this test indeed
tests at the very high range, and that it is really believed to
correlate to IQ. However, it is very much not a culture fair test, and
performing lower than expected would not indicate that one would not
perform much higher on a test that is not culture fair. This is an
incredibly difficult test, and it is not expected that any test taker
will test anywhere near the maximum. In fact on practice tests, one can
expect to make many mistakes, even if one performs extremely well. A
Mensa level score is one that feels quite poor in its results and number
of errors, and yet one learns that one’s score is quite good. If one
scored the maximum for this test, at 8 Standard Deviations, one’s
percentile IQ score would be expected to be</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Impressive deceased individuals leaving evidence of profound
realizations and productive eminence do not leave me with questions
about their intelligence, although I am concerned about hypothetical
scores concocted by those interested, that amount to frivolous
fabrications. While confirmed writings, art and diagrams may at some
time be adequate for AI or forensic intelligence measuring systems to
provide useful rank-ordered scores outside of any testing by a proctored
psychologist, I believe existing numbers for notable historical figures
were invented and are untrustworthy. Probably if they did not leave
behind sufficient productions it would be difficult to ascertain their
intelligence, even if they did produce great works. My personally
authored materials, in Book and Journal of Mattanaw, will leave behind
likely adequate data to do such a differential analysis on my
intelligence, even disincluding my intelligence scores. However, my
intelligence scores exist, and are confirmed. However, my range is not
known, having ceiling scores. Using my extremely productive life and
mass of artifacts shared openly, it should be possible later, to
estimate range above ceilings, using technology, particularly comparing
with what is produced by all other people.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Recently I had in my hands works from Leonardo Da Vinci on Human
Anatomy, and while impressed, I saw no reason to fabricate any
particular score for his intelligence. One might wonder what motivation
would lead someone to such an estimation, having no methodology with any
scientific foundation. In such a situation numbers provided appear to be
guesses by the excessively interested; the fan who can apply numbers at
will to guess IQs in way that damages history. To overstate Da Vinci’s
intelligence would not honor his biography as people think that it
would; instead it is much better to simply aggregate his works, to
admire them, and perhaps use them for estimation using methods which
might not yet exist, comparing them to results of modern thinkers who
were tested, or methods of AI. My work Book and Journal of Mattanaw, is
also my living autobiography. After death I would not want someone who
is unknowledgeable to begin overstating my intelligence, as it is
incorrect in the same way as understating it. I want my life to be known
correctly, or else enable people to admit when they are limited as to
evidence or exposure or <em>understanding</em> of my work
(<a href="6-mattanaw-2023">Mattanaw, 2023, 6</a>).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Mentioning Da Vinci’s name in this context bothers me, but wanting
some name from greater antiquity, I chose his. People are more willing
to speculate using those names from more recent times, who are very
familiar, but have left few artifacts, or have a readership. People have
not really read and understood Einstein, for example, and it appears he
does not have IQ scores, and his works cannot be comprehended by almost
anyone, read directly. Comparing with myself, this appears to be the
case as well. Highly intellectual works really are not read or
understood but only rarely, by others who are able to appreciate the
significance and have intelligence enough to understand what is
recorded.</p>

<p><em>More on this topic as it relates to the question pertaining to
Richard Feynman</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I do not believe myself qualified to pronounce final judgment on the
topic of Mr. Feynman’s actual intelligence scores, but I do think I can
offer some clarity as to the status of this curiosity. I am certain we
will not ever have information that will be satisfactory to us. Probably
if we could socialize information effectively, we would do well to bring
the topic to a rest, without any affirmative conclusion one way or
another–for Mr. Feynman’s benefit, and for our benefit of not having to
discuss it any longer. It is not fruitful and does not do justice to
Mr. Feynman, and I say as much, without diminishing the question put to
me, since it is important to emphasize that we certainly will not bring
the interest in the topic to a conclusion, but we can bring the topic
itself to a conclusion.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I am not aware of any validation of Feynman’s scores, self-reported
and otherwise. This is a perennial topic, a favorite, in the
intelligence community forums, I think because of the disparity between
his apparent and unquestioned smartness, success in a complex field
assumed to be one only accessible to minds of a certain quality, and his
having supposedly attained an FSIQ score that would not admit him into
Mensa. I’ve seen a score of 126 reported, but have also heard of a score
of 130, probably at SD16 given the time period of the tests he would
have been exposed to (meaning 132 would be the Mensa requirement for
that test). I have not seen any success towards finding facts about
Feynman’s mind, beyond these hearsay data points, that would be
equivalent to resurrecting and testing a perhaps reluctant Feynman with
modern tests.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I do not know of anyone I have ever seen discussing him in Mensa or
other group as holding the supposed score he attained against him.
Rather there is a desire to understand why he would not have scored
higher, given the inability of those in Mensa to perform those same
feats Feynman performed. “Why does it appear we cannot do what Feynman
could do?” Feynman is a Physics Olympiad winner, has had at least one
letter recommendation in college of one line stating he was a
mathematical genius. He introduced new methods and a system of notation
to his field, used by other highly acclaimed physicists only after his
contribution, with dependence.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I believe many think “I am not like him and yet I have a high
intelligence score.” Some may misjudge their potential, but probably
many really do realize they could not have the mathematical or
professional accomplishments Feynman had, given another lifetime of
opportunities to make attempts. His talent was evident while he was
young and he realized some of his potential as an adult.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This feeling of not having the ability to accomplish what I would
like, witnessing someone like Feynman, is not something I myself
experience. Seeing Feynman speak, and knowing what he has accomplished,
and witnessing his penetrating style of questioning, I see
characteristics I have. I am fortunate for not having a disparity
between these traits and my intelligence scores, and witnessing Feynman
I wish people would stop questioning him any longer.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Seeing Feynman I see someone who thinks somewhat like myself, but
someone with different interests; I see someone who I would gravitate
towards, perhaps, for more intimate friendship and conversation. I do
not know how focused he was on the field of physics, but suspect perhaps
we would have some differences with respect to range of conversation and
potential topics.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I raise the relationship between Mr. Feynman, and my feelings of
similarity to him, because this feeling is related to the validation of
other people for their intelligence, and there is was question about
identification of charlatans or perhaps dangerous individuals. I will
connect these topics when that question again arises in my responses
below.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Feynman’s intelligence will remain an unsettled issue, and I hope the
reader recognizes this, and agrees it is not worth being caught up in
the mystery any longer. FSIQ scoring relies on a range of tests, and his
mathematical abilities imply, by his performance, that he is very able
at least on some selection of these subtests. Would this imply that he
would perform well on culture-fair pattern recognition tests that would
relate to mathematical abilities, that could be used to estimate his
FSIQ, putting him in the higher ranges? Perhaps so, or perhaps not,
since interests can greatly control one’s participation in testing, but
it would be questionable still how meaningful such a test would be. It
may be, he would prefer to dwell on falsifying the answers to
intelligence questions. Test makers created expected answers, that
sometimes are not all answers, even on intelligence tests.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Mr. Feynman is already in the company of Physicists we prize for
having unattainable skills and accomplishments. Already he has reached
the eminence that the intelligence strive and fail to have for
themselves. I place Mr. Feynman in the category of the person of
historical interest for intelligence, for whom we have no verified IQ
scores we can trust. The conclusion that we cannot know his scores, and
instead ought to appraise him by his work, might be said for all those
others who are subjects of chronic speculation, including people I would
prefer not to name, but will do so, out of hopes the reader will
discontinue further speculation (Albert Einstein, Isaac Newton,
Aristotle, Jon von Neumann, Gauss, Charles Darwin, Johann Wolfgang von
Goethe, William James Sidis, John Stuart Mill, Bertrand Russell, and any
other eminent figure who antedates intelligence scoring, and any figure
who has not have intelligence scores taken, who has accomplishments that
seem superhuman to those who are aware they could not accomplish the
same.</p>

<p>Do you have any particularly favourite articles from Noesis: The
Journal of the Mega Society?</p>
<p><em>Christopher Matthew Cavanaugh (Mattanaw):</em></p>
<p>An article I stumbled upon that I quite enjoyed from Noesis is
entitled “The Too Many Aptitudes Problem,” written by Hank Pfeffer.</p>
<p>Articles such as this are pleasant for their confirmation that they
provide to those who may not have better articulated their own
experience. Growing up it was a challenge to really focus my attention
on activities that might be more valuable from the perspective of
securing my later well-being, reputation, and overall success. It was
also valuable confirmation to see the effects that many talents has on
attention, since being quite good at diverse tasks can have the
consequence of drawing one in many directions, and can create some
distress concerning finding those key things to do that are more
valuable and fulfilling versus temporarily gratifying for the feeling of
delight at experiencing ones skills or ability.</p>
<p>An article that has had a greater impact on me, was the article from
Grady Towers, not from Noesis, but from the Prometheus society. This
article articulates the alienation one experiences in society not being
able to fully express those talents and capacities in a way that is
readily received in one’s environment, and the increasing need to
occasionally have others who are able to receive this and give
confirmation to one’s mind that one experiences privately and cannot
well convey to the world, without willing and able communicators,
willing at times to be subject to overwhelming energy and intellection.
A work environment is not typically a hospitable environment to high
giftedness, because the organization must learn and grow at a pace that
is slower than, but roughly commensurate with, their normal
employees.</p>
<p>These two articles together are part of what I imagine to be somewhat
necessary reading for those who have interest in understanding the minds
of folks who belong to these high intelligence societies, or those who
belong to no society at all, but are functioning independently in the
world without any group support.</p>

<p><em>Some Comments on Maladaptation at the High Range.</em> I am a
Psychologist exposed, but not a scholar of the Terman study, but
understand that part of the results related to what was called
“maladaptive” patterns of behavior, which seemed to occur at a greater
rate as one approached the very highest scoring “termites” who were
subjects of the study. The Terman study is quite a long longitudinal
study, having interview touchpoints with subjects at different times of
life, with results comprising a number of volumes; and, for purposes of
this response, I’m relying more on the article from Grady Towers, which
touches on the same topic, and relies on some conclusions of the other
study. There is another topic, from Mr. Michael Ferguson, called “<a
href="http://michaelwferguson.blogspot.com/p/the-inappropriately-excluded-by-michael.html">The
Inappropriately Excluded</a><sup><a name="1">1</a></sup>,” and because
this article comes to mind, and is also quite well written, I feel I
must mention it.</p>
<p>This maladaptive trend relates, again, to the article mentioned
above, “The Outsiders”, and presents a consistent picture, that as one
moves along the normal distribution one finds people increasingly unable
to relate to the larger population around them, in ways that are
satisfying to themselves, but not necessarily those they interact with.
Of course such a phenomenon finds expression wherever people interact,
and is not exclusive to any particular environment where one might hope
to have rewarding work or rewarding relationships. Seeking environments
that offer satisfaction gradually becomes an exercise in futility, and
one finally succumbs to a life that is somewhat lonely, if certain
optional decisions or social situations do not occur. This means an
apparently futile life, or lonely existence, is one that is potentially
wanted and chosen, or results from lack of hospitable environment,
however a person feels about it. Some are fortunate enough to find group
membership with others who might be hard to find for geographic
distribution, and are able to finally have mutually satisfying
interactions. Rare people are separated and appear at a distance
oftentimes. Work environments might not be possible to find, or may have
obstacles and hindrances from admission and entry, that are themselves
designed for those who fall lower on the spectrum, and may present an
unsatisfying situation of having to “hoop jump” along to a satisfying
academic career, that one already surpassed simply using the mind.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I qualify in every way and yet on paper I do not qualify”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>was something I experienced and still experience to this day,
wondering if Ph.d or two would be worth anything to me, and if years of
study to complete a paper dissertation were something valuable given I
can easily write papers on par with dissertations, having paid for no
Ph.d program, and without having gone through any of the laborious steps
to qualify for admissions.</p>
<p>This writing here, again, provides some relationship with the
question as to the results of the Terman study, but not being a Terman
scholar, and finding this interview a good opportunity to speak for
myself, and others who experienced some suffering at the thought of not
finding a suitable environment for self-expression, and realization of
potential, I thought I’d speak to the ultimate place it leads, which is
the feeling of a repulsively slow corporate and academic edifice that
strings one along with promises of doctorates and degrees, and good
careers, that seem to have little tangible value for being disconnected
from concrete accomplishments which flow readily from the mind, but are
quite well connected with long and expensive and torturous submissive
experiences being a student-customer. One wonders why one cannot read
and work in labs without having to spend a decade or more paying for
education in indentured servitude at a pace that is for people who are
in the normal range and not the extraordinary range. The pace may not
really be for those in the normal range, but appear also to be for
slowing progress, and for ensuring people stay within siloes and
divisions, to perform more specialized work only.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I learned this as a child, a teen, again as a young adult, and again
I must pay to certify to this, vaguely, over perhaps a decade as a
university student, without any consumer controls?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such experiences as not being able to express oneself as oneself in a
mode appropriate for accelerated learning, can lead gradually to a
feeling of unfulfillment and the feeling that the world has not situated
its institutions or its organizations for such people. Instead they were
made for and by others and one must simply find a way to enjoy one’s
experience.</p>

Pathways in Life, And the Desire to Blend Them</a></h3>
<p>The primary pathway decision faced by those are highly intelligent
appears to be the following, which is how I experienced it: 1. Is it
worth the time and frustration to attain organizational success, given I
do not value it all that much? 1. Is it worth the time and risks to
pursue a high income, for the leisure attained, or is it more valuable
to choose a modest income, easily achieved, and commit? 1. How can I
conserve energy for thinking about what I would like to think about, and
for doing what I would like to do?</p>
<p>On all three points above, most will grapple, and perhaps not find a
long-term solution. People have a hard time choosing to save over having
material comforts for long periods of time. Some have a lot of trouble
identifying what they care about as far as their use of minds and time;
whereas, some highly intelligent people will choose the easiest of jobs
to automate their performance, freeing their mind completely for their
own thoughts, which might have nothing at all to do with work, while
others observing their behavior, wonder why they might not opt for
materials and organizational success? These people have not been able to
disentangle that what one values doing with one’s mind is separate from
pleasing others socially, and gaining materials that others find
attractive.</p>
<p>Appropriate employment for the talented and especially gifted seems
to be a greater rarity than being especially talented or gifted, and
realizing this early, many have to make choices to settle into jobs and
professions that simply do not provide stimulation and opportunities
that might be entirely satisfying. It is an odd thing though, to think
that organizations should have occupations fulfilling such a need.
Employment is not for those being employed, except for in rare
circumstances. Occupations, instead, fulfill market opportunities,
closely related to desired extraction by a business owner. A business
owner is aware of some opportunity for earning money, and creates an
organizational structure, most often starting with himself/herself,
which effectively gains money on their effort. Seeing more market
opportunity, and understanding the desirability of having leisure time,
the owners hire employees that they pay less for similar efforts.
Organizations grow indefinitely on this pyramid pathway, with the
ownership amassing wealth obtained from increasing market opportunity
and an increase of employees who are paid less than their actual value.
This discrepancy in value, is what incentivizes the ownership to
continue to grow their business, and to improve their business, likely
with much fewer hours of contribution, but greater contribution using
mental contributions.</p>
<p>Business owners attain much of what an intelligent person wants for
themselves, and likely the business owner is intelligent, but most often
not as intelligent as someone in the highest ranges. People outside the
highest ranges recognize the intelligence of business owners,
particularly owners of businesses that are extremely desirable and high
earning, and identify business success with intelligence. However, this
is a misidentification. Those who are well positioned with modest
intelligence are in a better position, it appears, for this type of
success, than those in the highest ranges, who are interested in things
like artistic creation, intellectual creations, and simply thinking
about things that are not so mundane as business.</p>
<p>It is obvious too, however, that those in the highest ranges would
benefit from being business owners, or being employees at the very top
of the business, if the business is so well developed, that a special
intelligentsia is needed for maintaining it. This occurs in
organizations like large software companies, scientific companies, and
organizations of government, like NASA. Similar demands, exist,
certainly for military organizations, like the Air Force and other, that
recruit specifically for gifted people. However, these people who become
employed do not necessarily control the range or extent of their tasks,
and even at the top, there may be an expectation of much specialization.
So the highest range individual, who wants freedom of mind to connect
diverse topics, finds themselves someone well rewarded with respect to
income, and yet give up energy and hours to devote themselves to still
trivial specialized tasks. From outside, these highly intelligent people
may appear quite well off, when in reality they are understimulated and
still have few opportunities for maximizing potential. For this reason,
these roles can be filled by those who are intelligent but are still not
of the very highest intelligence, and these more moderately intelligent
people might be more completely fulfilled. The most intelligent would
benefit most greatly from the freedoms of being the owners of the
business, where wealth might enable them to go beyond their own business
to a range of activities that permit higher generality, higher
interdisciplinarian, and the like, or simply time to pursue activities
that free the mind.</p>
<p>It appears that these business ownership opportunities are still not
for all those who are highly intelligent, and appears somewhat
uninteresting. There is also competition with those who might already
have wealth, might already inherit the businesses, might already be in a
position of understanding very closely the market opportunities even if
one is highly intelligent, one does not necessarily have market feel and
experience, and incentive to succeed when there is a market opportunity,
which might be invisible except for those who are involved. Involvement
then can provide better opportunity than raw intelligence.</p>
<p>The highly intelligent then, opt for pursuing whatever is satisfying
to their own minds, and have to gauge the risks associated with trying
to find a career that produces income, sacrificing time and energy, that
could be used for thinking freely instead.</p>
<p>I personally prefer one of two types of employment:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Doing something that is so easy that it requires no thinking, but is
in a healthful environment; or</li>
<li>Doing something that is so complicated nobody else can do it, that
is rewarding in income. Such a job is a rarity, and I was fortunate to
find myself given opportunities after expending much time, at much risk,
just seeing if such opportunities would ever come into existence.</li>
</ol>
<p>At present, I run my own organization of one, as a Consultant guiding
large organizations. I was able to build such a company, only after
having attained Chief Architect at Adobe Systems, and Solutions
Consultant, a role similar to that performed by Edward Snowden. One
might think, being Chief Architect would be satisfying, and it was for a
period, because I could work on tasks that were very high complexity.
However, there was also the reality of limitations of colleagues and
employees that could not necessarily execute in complex ways, if not for
their own limitations (there were many talented colleagues), for
inability to organize projects effectively. I found myself still unable
to retain my intellectual property as well, and unable to eradicate
manipulative tendencies of managers who wanted to shift roles, and do so
without increasing income more than what was scheduled. Meaning my
talents, which were obvious to all, could not create rewards in any way
like at a business. So I left this job and discovered, that in business
I had a much better level of control of my income, which was higher, and
ownership of my productions.</p>
<p>Even in my own business, the opportunities from clients dictate the
complexity of what I’m doing. However, I can advance my business in any
way I like as I perform this work, alongside, owning all my own
contributions. If I wanted to work less I could work less. I could
travel as desired. I ended up getting all that I wanted very precisely,
exactly obtaining what I set out to obtain. However, I did not know that
it would turn out this way, and many fortuitous circumstances made it
possible. Having had a very good and elevate role at this software
company enabled me to culminate my career as far as titles are
concerned, and my subject matter expertise was desired by those in my
network I already knew, and companies who had needs from an elevated
consultant. So I am of the few who were able to combine personal mental
goals with social-organizational, academic, and income advancement
goals, that are sometimes quite opposite to one’s interests, sacrificing
time and energy, with uncertain results. I recognize that my mental
needs, are quite unlike many if all colleagues I have ever had, who seem
more settled and less restless in their roles, even when they change
little, because they seem to have a suitable level of complexity still,
even in specialization, and an income level that, under
social-comparison, appears good to themselves and those who might pay
attention. They are able to gain material benefits that they think are
enough for their personal goals, and stay in their roles for very long
periods of time.</p>
<p>This is not satisfying to someone like myself, who needs to combine
things further, have greater complexity, and greater control over
income, locale, etc… What I wanted I communicated to a manager once, who
upon reading my desires, must have felt quite powerless to support me. I
wanted greater “Idea execution” potential. I’m chronically having ideas
that nobody finds interesting, that have high value, and high
interdisciplinarian. They are general and abstract, and hard to
communicate, and require money to bring to fruition. These goals relate
to personal interests, that I’ve had since I was a teenager; goals I
would have sacrificed my career for, if I could have achieved them
otherwise.</p>
<p>I wanted:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Time and energy to have important ideas and to be able to write
about those ideas.</li>
<li>Later I wanted resources, especially monetary resources, and
ownership of my own IP, to record those ideas into actual writing, and
software.</li>
<li>Later I wanted those ideas to connect to business objectives
supporting a range of industries, and to be able to deploy those ideas
at those business and industries, in an organization changing way,
supporting people and their goals.</li>
<li>I wanted to connect these writings with sufficient accomplishments
to create authority, and was able to do so in connecting it to my lofty
titles I’ve had in doing business with customers, and academically,
after many challenges, finally obtaining a number of degrees, and
gaining admission at Harvard University, a well-respected
organization.</li>
</ol>
<p>Highly intelligent people want to be able to communicate those
thoughts they have that seem to be greatly valuable. As a teenager I was
having many ideas I thought could change the world for the better. At
that time, I knew there was a very long path ahead for having any
credibility that would cause a readership to have any interest at all. I
knew even my own family would not read my writings, and my friends would
not either. If they would not ready my writing, who would? Who would
care to read anything I had to think about?</p>
<p>These are other reasons why I felt the need to have organizational
and academic attainments. They had to be enough to create attention or
authority. Accomplishments in the High Intelligence societies was a
completely unexpected phenomena, but that occurred along the way too,
after reconfirming my intelligence once again, working as a software
architect at the Food Network (more precisely, Scripps Networks, whose
television channels were later taken on by Discovery, including HGTV,
Travel Channel, etc… other businesses I also supported). While
performing a complex role, I thought to myself, “Why have I not joined
Mensa already?” Impressed at my seeming ability to do my job at an
increasingly challenging level, at a pace that seemed to exceed
colleagues, who I already respected for their abilities, I thought to
confirm what I learned in youth. I confirmed again my abilities and
joined Mensa, and began interacting there and in a number of other
groups. While simply socializing, while doing my work in software, and
in academia, I attained a level of respect, and attention, and many
personal relationships, which further developed some notoriety in the
High IQ societies. Now I’m quite well recognized in the High IQ
community, and inso doing, developed at least some interested
readership.</p>
<p>Today I have potential for a healthy writing career, apart from
writing I do in my work for various organizations in a number of
industries (making it more challenging, and more interesting, having
very different customers with different needs, in different places, even
international locations, like New Zealand). I have the authority
requisite, and some niche readership, and a blog with underlying
technology I own, having written the software from scratch and from
various pieces freely available (which is normal in creating software
products), for artistic and communication satisfaction.</p>
<p>These productions feed my business value as well, so I was able to
connect the value of my personal writings, and underlying software, to
the creations of large organizations. For example, I have recently
designed the technology for AbbVie, Inc’s international website, which
was deployed without issue, and connected my ideas shared with that
organization, with ideas developed in my personal life and in my
business.</p>
<p>There is an odd synthesis to my career, which is satisfying beyond
what I thought possible, and it appears to be precisely what would be
rewarding to others in the very highest ranges of intelligence. In fact,
communicating with many of them, I become aware of their journey’s,
which do resemble my own. I very much wish that many who are looking for
the same fulfillment are able to find it. While I find myself admiring
the person who would eschew organizational attainment for purely mental
attainment, and productions outside of existing organizational
structures, and academia, I hope they are able to have income attainment
and experiences that are able to broaden their communication potential.
Because that is what they want—they want to be able to share what is in
their minds, that they might be unable to share.</p>
<p>I believe the level of preparation required for someone in the very
high range of intelligence to share what they would like to share from
their minds, to be quite extraordinary. There is no doubt to me that
many others in the community would like to have the organizational,
academic, and software/writing IP ownership that I have, relating to my
writings. Without having gone through decades of preparations, which may
not be fortuitous, I do think smaller outlets at communicating to a
perhaps receptive audience is still very desirable. Articles like that
from Grady Towers, and Hank Pfeffer, discussed earlier, are unlikely to
have a wide readership, or interest, even being shared through channels
like Mega and Prometheus. However, they can connect with audiences who
can benefit directly, and I have some debt to their works.</p>
<p>In the high intelligence society journals, works seems to have a lack
of academic developments that would dissuade some readers from having a
prolonged interest, and this again is part of what I mean about the
extraordinary requirements of sharing one’s mind, at this level. One
seems to need to exceed what can be produced academically, somehow. This
can be achieved, with some notice, if the writing has an informality
that is greatly offset by the power of what is stated. Some writers seem
to be able to pull this off, but it may go unnoticed by those who might
not be able to discern, since the mind-matching I mentioned is required
for appraising significance more fully. What they would like to say is
quite remarkable, and they communicate extremely effectively and
powerfully. But they lack very definitely in having the academic and
career undergrowth, that would seem to provide more formal authority to
their writings, and I believe they would want this for themselves, if
they could have it. But alas, academic life is slow and torturous, and
their minds being too fast, cannot sometimes take the frustrations
associated. I experienced this myself and many times needed breaks in
college, for becoming disillusioned in the supposed objectives of higher
education, easily obtained independently, but without papers.</p>
<p>There is a concept I became acquainted with somewhat recently, stated
to be ikigai, and trusting that’s real Japanese, relay it here to the
reader. This word relates to the fulfillment of joining interests in
such a way that time is spent doing things that seem more holistic.
Work, talent, interest, and gainful employment are related to one
another. Such a term might lead the reader there is no special interest
connecting, then, to high giftedness, but that is not the case. Rather,
the size of the effort at synthesizing diverse talents and interests
seems to be at stake. “How do I combine all my talents into one and into
gainful employment”, considering Hank Pfeffer’s article, seems a
somewhat silly pursuit. This is why I think certain forms of employment,
again, seem like they are not appropriate to certain people. “Will this
organization create ikigai from all my interests?” appears the absurdist
of questions, particularly given the objectives of owners. People like
myself worked in youth believing it to be impossible to make ikigai
occur in a satisfying way. “It is impossible and so I will give up on
this” appears a result of the Terman study for some. I believe it to be
very challenging and wonder if perhaps there is a greater ikigai for me
in the future, while at the same time, I recognize what I have is
something quite out of the ordinary, and I am contented for what I have
at the moment, even if it could be better in some ways. I admit it is
hard to think it could be better, unless great riches are in my
future.</p>
<p>(Perhaps remove the section below)</p>
<p>I think many of the highly intelligent understand this issue early,
and opt for choosing what appears the lowest risk pathway, for
preserving energy for doing what one considers to be most valuable. In
my life, having been influenced greatly by the works of various
philosophers, who could only make their achievements having very
abundant leisure time, I chose to pursue the very greatest income I
could attain, while simultaneously devaluing income as having only
secondary value. I had an interest in being a hermit on one hand, living
alone and in nature, with few needs, and a desire to live in an urban
environment, spending freely to enjoy the benefits of restaurants, not
cooking, and having a nice apartment cared for by a landlord, so I had
nearly no concerns whatsoever in doing mundane tasks. I value doing
things with my hands in nature, and I value the benefits of having no
needs for doing housework and mechanical tasks, so that I can focus
exclusively on mental-academic pursuits, like reading and writing. I
noticed though, that one can have all that one values if one has money.
Ideally, one can have it without too much toil and self-sacrifice, and
those who were born into wealth know the value of having had to do
nothing at all to obtain it. Suddenly they have leisure to do anything
and everything they want that they value perhaps intrinsically. The high
intellect does benefit from being born into wealth, and many famous
philosophers and scientists did not need to work incredibly hard to
amass a savings providing security.</p>
<p>I was not born into such a scenario and knew, whatever success I
might have in organizations, and success in income attainment, or
business, would come primarily from myself, although I did have parents
who were financially supportive as I was growing to be an independent
adult. I would never be able to have a significant savings exclusively
coming from my family, and I assumed there would never be an inheritance
to wait for, which is something I personally detested as well. My
parents would deplete their resources in their interests, and I would
have no ongoing connection to their financial wellbeing.</p>
<p>So in my early 20’s I strove for financial independence, in a context
that was not incredibly favorable.</p>
<p>It was especially unfavorable for a period due to my choice to drop
out of High School. I experienced the improbability of advancing in a
job I had during the period of not being in school, making 6 dollars an
hour, even after being promoted, and recognized that organizational
success in academics, and in work, might be the only way I could gain a
significant income.</p>
<p>How easy or accessible is it to earn a high income, in my case? Is
this something I value, and want to pursue, to advance my own interests,
or are my interests incompatible with such a life? Should I choose a
more modest way of living, and do what brings value, giving my
worldview, or should I find a way to secure an easier life with surplus
money and material resources, to give myself more leisure time for my
pursuits.</p>
<p>I think there is a real dichotomous divide here, and that most people
have to make decisions about this in order to secure their well-being at
all stages of their lives.</p>
<p>One difference that appears to exist, is the degree of consideration
made about this question early in life, versus later. Some appear to
drift along, moving from one moment to the next, as if this were not a
real question. Some will struggle through business without having a real
aptitude for earning. Some will not make a choice between material
interests in consumption, and saving funds, and will remain in debt,
wanting both and never reconciling desires.</p>
<p>I think those in the very high IQ ranges are more likely to reconcile
material interests with what seems to be of genuine value, and make
calculations as to the reasonability of attaining a special degree of
organizational or financial social success, and high income. Some eschew
organizational and financial attainment early, seeing its transitory
social value, and seeing the time requirements for building wealth, and
simply choose a path that will never produce the awe that one might
expect from an exceptional mind that finds fame. These are highly
intelligent people who recognize real futility early. “Even if I attain
wealth, I know the following will occur and I will be unsatisfied.”</p>
<p>Then there is another segment, who recognizes this, and yet sees a
very difficult path ahead not pursuing high income. How will I ever
write what I wish to write without the leisure time and energy to do so?
How can I spend my time doing mundane work, depleting my energy, only to
find at the completion of their workdays, they are having less and less
energy, over time, to do anything felt to be valuable.</p>
<h3
id="the-value-of-the-mensa-membership-from-my-perspective"><a name="the-value-of-the-mensa-membership-from-my-perspective">The
Value of the Mensa Membership from My Perspective</a></h3>
<p><em>Relating to the question: What does a Mensa International
membership mean to you?</em></p>
<p>There was a quote that I’ll paraphrase from memory, from an African
American Astronaut who is a Member of Mensa, who was asked the same
question:</p>
<p>“Being a member of Mensa means, to me, that I no longer have to think
or talk about how smart I am.”</p>
<p>I have the same view, perhaps for being exposed to his, and for this
reason I chose to become a Life Member. It is done and I no longer need
to dwell further on this topic.</p>
<p>The second extremely meaningful thing to me about Mensa, and other
societies, is the access to extraordinary people, who are not
necessarily extraordinary for having attained ephemeral social
successes. These are people who one yearns to meet for the sort of
mind-matching and communication mentioned above.</p>
<p>I’ve met valuable people all over, and have come to meet exceptional
people quite naturally in my demanding career. But one can simply meet
people who are exceptional by joining Mensa. I regret that there is a
barrier to entry, to get into this group, to talk to certain people, but
it is a barrier that is necessary, even if it is arbitrary.</p>
<p>I suggest to the reader who might be obstructed from admission (there
are people who definitely belong who simply have not gained the paper
test scores making it possible to enter), to focus on academic
experiences and join groups interested and focused on specific sciences,
arts, and experiences, because as soon as you are in these environments,
you witness the results of intelligence in beautiful ways, and attention
is on quality. When one visits a museum and experiences people
interested in museums, quality is apparent. Quality is not always
apparent in the high IQ community, and one has to be long exposed to
find exceptional people, or exceptional moments, even there, with the
exception of meetings in person, which were more consistently rewarding.
I mention this to the reader, because genuinely, one finds the same
qualities one is hoping for on both pathways, and people are appearing
in these groups when they are not appearing in the high IQ
societies.</p>
<p>It’s quite a nice experience to witness people’s productions and
strengths without having any idea how they would perform being tested,
and oftentimes one has no care or concern at all, being quite pleased
with the diverse strengths one is witnessing. I think this offers an
answer too, about the rewards of tangible accomplishments, over and
above what a test score might indicate (although again, that is very
important for some people in unexpected ways too).</p>

More About Intelligent People, and How they are Measured, and
Intelligence Itself</a></h3>
<p><em>Relating to the question: How can individuals read more on
matters of IQ, societies, intelligence, and the like, outside of the
references in the article?</em></p>
<p>I commented in the article cited by Mr. Jacobsen that an effective
method for gaining an understanding of highly intelligent people is
watching them speak and communicate, and that it would be especially
interesting to move away from watching figures who are well known, to
view those who are not well-known. Fame is unrelated to the expression
of people who are extremely intelligent, and very few attain any sort of
fame, or interest from others who are unlike them. I suggested in my
brief blog post that one good approach would be to watch YouTube videos.
Presumably mostly famous people are available for viewing on YouTube,
and so here I offer an alternative: it may be possible to attend High IQ
conferences as a journalist or interested outsider, and one may thereby
gain opportunities for talking with incredibly intelligent people,
gathered all together. Rather than pursuing individuals for interviews
or their time discussing topics of mutual interest, it may be helpful to
find them all in one place, gathering for their annual meetups and so
forth. People in this community are welcoming, for the most part, of
people outside of the community, because of course, their loving spouses
and family members cannot be expected to fall in the same IQ range. Thus
they will bring family members to events, and so not only will you find
opportunities for talking with very smart people, you will have chances
for talking with their significant others, and family members, who might
have very interesting things to say about their highly intelligent
family member. These people would be pleasant company too, creating a
good and comfortable environment if one is wanting to know more but is
not a member of the societies themselves.</p>
<p>This would give some ideas about how people in the societies are in
person, but even still, quite a lot is not revealed about who highly
intelligent people are, and how they perform under demanding
circumstances, like those conditions created by proctored IQ
testing.</p>
<p>I took my first IQ test as a young child and remember it very well.
The reader, if schooled in a district that tests for giftedness, might
have some recollections of these early tests too, and perhaps what they
enjoyed or disliked about those tests. I think it likely that a very
large population of people have a good understanding already of IQ and
what IQ testing consists of, and some idea about range, and aptitudes. I
recall vividly my experience doing specific tests around manipulating
triangles and other shapes to construct larger shapes, with a
psychometrician or psychologist, in my elementary school, in a private
room. I also recall having to estimate the number of blocks that were
within larger configurations of blocks at different orientations. I
recall these tests, I believe, because I was quite good at them. Taking
IQ tests in my thirties, many years later, I excelled at these same
tests again, obtaining ceiling scores. I can obtain ceiling scores on
other tests too, and in general, I do not have a fearful relationship
with intelligence testing or intelligence as a result. I would suggest
that if a reader has some fear around IQ tests, it may relate to some
recollection at having a difficult time on IQ tests, which are intended
to be difficult, and are for most of the population. This experience may
typify test taking recollections.</p>
<p>In order to get additional confirmation about one’s suspected IQ
range, it may be useful to again take proctored examinations as an
adult. One could take the Mensa test and get a feel for range, but I
would more seriously suggest taking a proctored examination with a
psychologist. These can be somewhat costly, but they give the in person
experience of test selection by the psychologist (you can take these
tests more than once, after a period of some years elapse, and they
would not be precisely the same test, although the tests would feel
quite similar). Professional, hand-written score reports are provided by
the psychologist too, and these are quite nice to include as part of
one’s historical documents and autobiography. However, while making
these suggestions, I do have some reservations, thinking the reader
probably really does already have a good idea of range, and probably, if
there isn’t a specific personal reason to get confirmation, the primary
reason for taking a test would have to be research on intelligence, or
out of some interest in psychology, psychometrics and the like. Since
the question above was put forth without any indication about personal
self-interest in obtaining confirming scores, I suggest this in-person
test taking as a very good method for gaining a better understanding of
intelligence as a part of research interests.</p>
<p>When I was being trained to become a Psychologist in my University
Studies, I also obtained text books that provided a very good historical
context for the development of IQ tests, and also a good foundation
about the validity of the tests, and yet again, information about how
they are proctored and performed by licensed psychologists who are able
to obtain the published tests, and instructions for scoring. If one gets
far enough along in studies of Psychology, one can obtain the tests
themselves. I did not pursue this, but through the combination of
reading on how tests are administered, and taking the tests with
Psychologists who shared more information, I gained a very complete
understanding. But beyond this, it is possible to “get the keys to the
tests” and administer the Stanford Binet and other tests to those who
want to know more. This is a very valuable pursuit, because it can
reveal cognitive impairments in children, and also reveal high
giftedness in those who will need special education. When I obtained my
tests as an adult, it appeared that the primary customers of
psychologists providing the tests were to confirm definite strengths and
weaknesses in children who were already known to parents and adults to
have special difficulties or special strengths. There seemed to be less
of an interest in parents with kids who seemed to be well balanced and
have normal functioning. Functioning in the normal range there seems to
be less of a need for special attention, and therefore perhaps less
motivation to take costly tests with a psychologist, after having
already been tested by a psychologist, perhaps for free, in the public
or private education systems.</p>
<p>If one wants to know more, one can reach out to me as well, since I
have considerable experience, all life long, with the experience of
being gifted in the high range, of having training to become a
Psychologist within this personal context, of having had a number of
tests longitudinally over my lifespan, and of having experience with
others in person, and in forums, who are extremely highly intelligent,
in the very highest ranges of intelligence. One can reach me at the
contact information below. I would be enthusiastic to hear from readers
interested, whoever they might be, so long as they are kind and
well-intentioned:</p>
<p><a name="concluding-response"></a></p>
<h3 id="concluding-response">Concluding Response</h3>
<p>Those topics I find most interesting for further development might
be, firstly, coming to a defined process that would allow people for a
method for identifying risky people, which they could self-train or be
trained on, and secondly, coming to an even more clear understanding of
the role of conversation in identifying the most gifted, and who must be
in the conversation for that process to have a better feel for
identifying the level of giftedness that the person has, in a rough way,
not to pretend to know the intelligence of the person specifically, but
to know they are in the range they claim very likely, and are not
charlatains, or are not of risk.</p>
<h2 id="interview-questions">Interview Questions</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Questions 1 and 2.</em></strong> You wrote an
interesting article entitled “How Do People With IQs Over 180 Act and
Think?” (Cavanaugh, 2018). You bring forward individuals like Richard
Feynman, Bertrand Russell, Paul Cooijmans, Grady Towers, and societies
such as the Mega Society, the Giga Society, and Mensa International. By
and large, these are well-known within the high-IQ communities, of which
I sit out in the Oort Cloud with a telescope making notes enjoying the
show and sending occasional correspondence for interviews with members
of these communities. I am not a formal member of these communities. I
have contributed to publications or had positions for which I’m
grateful, but no formal legitimate memberships because of no formal test
to determine the merit of the matter or deep abiding interest at that
level, as some societies do not require test scores, permit second test
scores, or utilize, widely, alternative tests with varying degrees of
legitimacy in the measurement of the psychological construct of g,
general intelligence. As far as I know, those societies with strict
mainstream intelligence test requirements are Mensa International and
the Triple Nine Society, especially with Mensa International having
formal testing sites online or, pre-coronavirus, invigilation stations
all over the world. These are important to consider, internationally,
even sophisticated frauds exist in the high-IQ communities with a
grotesque example in the multi-level marketer (scammer), human
trafficker, and cult leader Keith Raniere with the organization NXIVM
where he was known as “Vanguard.” To a more on-point tune and as a point
of clarification to start us off here today, with Feynman’s declared IQ
of 126 (no S.D. mentioned), as stated in the article, what is the
factual status of Feynman’s declared IQ in contrast to professional
commentary or considerations of his mathematical abilities?</li>
<li><strong><em>Question 3.</em></strong> Do you have any particularly
favourite articles from Noesis: The Journal of the Mega Society?</li>
<li><strong><em>Question 4.</em></strong> What was the eventual outcome
or the larger conclusions from the Terman Study?</li>
<li><strong><em>Question 5.</em></strong> What seem like the common
reasons for the exceptionally intelligent and profoundly intelligent
finding inappropriate employment or remaining
unemployed/underemployed?</li>
<li><strong><em>Quesiton 6.</em></strong> The most legitimate
intelligence test scores tend to come from comprehensive tests with
money and research dumped at them, e.g., the SB and the WAIS. Yet, their
ranges are fairly tight around 40/45 to 160/155 on S.D. 15. Some
statistical, psychometric techniques, e.g., Rasch-equated, have been
employed by individual experimental psychologists, e.g., Dr. Xavier
Jouve, to extrapolate for claimed scores at 175 S.D. 15, for example.
Alternative tests made by independent test constructors are interesting
and vary in quality, though have a far larger quantity. In the article,
bluntly, you state, “140,150,160,170,180 are the numbers immediately
grasped by liars and exaggerators.” When using alternative tests, fake
names or pseudonyms, or more than the first test attempt to claim a
score at 140, 150, 160, 170, and 180, what are first thoughts coming to
mind to you?</li>
<li><strong><em>Question 7.</em></strong> How can individuals protect
themselves from scammers?</li>
<li><strong><em>Question 8.</em></strong> Why should individuals stick
to professional achievements positive for individual authentic
self-esteem and the common good rather than test score?</li>
<li><strong><em>Question 9.</em></strong> What does a Mensa
International membership mean to you?</li>
<li><strong><em>Question 10.</em></strong> How can individuals read more
on matters of IQ, societies, intelligence, and the like, outside of the
references in the article?</li>

Topics include ethics, art, fitness, finances, health, psychology, and vegetarianism. The common theme connecting all articles is moral philosophy, even if that is not immediately apparent. Any of my articles that touch on "the good and virtuous life" will be published here. These articles interrelate with my upcoming theory of ethics, two decades in preparation.<p><p>I welcome and appreciate constructive feedback and conversation with readers.
