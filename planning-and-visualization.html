<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Planning and visualization comprises tasks that were not previously
combined in the prior system, but here are combined because they involve
activities that should be joined. Initially the planning here mentioned
involved tasks that were collected for performance during the day, and
these were recorded and reminded using the paper <a
href="persona-form.html">Personal Form</a>. The visualization involved
the imagining of the course of the day and certain events to be avoided,
or to be created. This relates to planning because in planning there is
the addition of certain acts, and potentially the removal of unwanted
acts. Combining tasks lists with visualization in advance of the course
of events later increases the chance of successfully completing
plans.</p>
<p>When I first started the visualization section it was due to
recognition of unwanted habits which had combined negative effects on 1)
Health, 2) Body weight, 3) Planned nutrition, 4) Planned Events, and 5)
Decreased Livelihood via Decreased Money. Additionally there was the
strengthening of habits which would predictably lead to repetition of
the same unwanted behaviors, which have the above negative connetion
points and others besides. At the time I was overweight so my
relationship was of lower quality too.</p>
<p>For example, suppose I wanted to refrain from eating some particular
fast food at some place I overly frequnted. Some in ordinary life,
without understanding of psychology, will simply reprimand and repeat
that one should not engage in that behavior. Howver, clearly if habitual
there are issues of compulsion, inability to remember or appreciate
other goals, automaticity in behavior, perhaps reduced energy for
decision at the time performed, and so on.</p>
<p>Visualization supports in providing a method that increases the
probability of change of habitual behavior, because it allows for
thinking through the actions desired at a time when there is still
abundant energy, but before the expected behavior, so there is the
limitation that the visualization does not itself change the behavior
that comes later. Visualization, however, is intended to be a vivid
visual recreation of events, and creation of desired events, in the
mind, such that when the time comes, the visualized behavior is that
which is performed. Emphasis is not on removeal of an act, but on which
act is desired. So if I wanted to avoid having a particular fast food,
what I would visualize doing is something alternative which is what I
would prefer to be doing. So instead of driving home one particular
route that passes by that fast food location, I would visualize the
pathway home from work, and how I would feel, and the desirability of
seeing anohter route home, and of seeing what I would see on that path
that would be desireable, and seeing myself take the course with stops
and sights that are very different, all of the way home. The result,
sometimes is quite successful. Having already visualized the pathway, I
would drive home feeling like I already took that path, and perhaps even
that this occasion was not even the first occasion of going that way.
It’s a first attempt at creating a habitual behavior without having
already engaged in that behavior. Taking this other pathway, the fast
food place is totally avoided. Compulsions attached to triggers and
automaticities are avoided because that location and its cues and
spatial characteristics, and branding remdinders, and conditioned
feelings are no longer there at all.</p>
<p>In this section of the personal form today, I may place certain tasks
from my backlog of tasks that have special priority. I think now of my
tasks as a very large set of tasks that were not already completed,
rather than thinking of them as tasks that <em>must</em> be done during
the day at the time they are recorded. However, that is in part due to
my being semi-retired, and my not having any strong need to complete
anything any particular day. Shifting my calendar to cycles and shifts,
I would recommend that others think of their to-do list as a backlog
too, becasue the completion of tasks is not especially well related to
single days, but more related to getting things done over a longer
period of time. In work environments there is a methodology called
“agile methodology” which takes this same perspective. Work carries over
through the entire year, and iterations on development is preferred over
hard milestones, even though occasionally milestones are also desirable
and cannot be removed. Nevertheless, healthy completion of tasks from a
backlog with the idea that cyclical completions occur over longer spans
than days is really useful for training to complete longer term projects
too. Instead of trying to complete something finally and fast, there is
the better feeling of progress that really has no end or a more distant
end. Fitness to achieve a certain look is less desirable than creating
smaller goals involving habits that carry over the lifespan. After
having completed my career I accout my success in part to this
perspective, and benefit from it more considering that I simply have a
large number of tasks to do, and can do some of them now, but will have
plenty to do later. Having plenty to do later is nice because then one
has not run out of things to do, which may help some who get bored or
those who forget what they could be doing.</p>
<p>After selecting a task from my backlog and recording it on my form,
which allows me to remind myself later of what I will do, like shop at
the grocery store to get specific needed items, I will visualize my
course such that I totally complete the task, in a positive way (meaning
if I’m avoiding something, again, I replace that with what I will be
doing, rather than dwell on that thing to be avoided). For example,
suppose my list at the grocery store does not include a specific food. I
will trace through the grocery store focused on what I will get, and I
will avoid those portions of the store that might include the food I
don’t want or triggers to get that food. I learned a while back one
method which supports this, which is to shop the produce and outer
portion of the store but not the inner portions of the store, which
include ailes with more expensive processed foods. So if I visualize my
path through the store it will likely be the local store, going through
produce, maybe to the healthier section with vegetarian items, and the
frozen section, picking up those items on the list, as if no other items
existed.</p>
<p>This type of visualization in advance would be performed by me
normally in the mornings. The first thing I would do before working
would be to take out the form and go through each section. The first
section would be the tasks, and a later section would be visualization,
although now they would be combined. I am developing this further so I
may switch to a more mnemonic approach, but initially, getting back into
it again, I will utilize the personal form once again. At this point I
will choose those tasks most important to me, and I would visualize the
pathway taken later in the accomplishment of those tasks. This takes
time to do, so one cannot do it for each and everything that one wants
to do, unless one finds a way to repeat visualizations later. That could
be possible, but I have not achieved this. Instead I had limited energy
and I would do it at once when focused on that section of the form.</p>
<p>There is more to the visualization in that the visualization also
includes other workflows of interest that accomplish important daily
tasks in a short time. For example, there is the morning routine which
is designed to allow for doing almost everything mundane that one needs
to do in a day in the morning all in one chunk of time. The idea here is
that by the time the morning is over, all that is required to be done is
already done, except those things that might be work or education
related. Now I would consider that such a routine would create a full
day of time for doing things I would prefer to do over mundane things.
However the mundane things included not only chores and simple necessary
tasks, but also tasks that are essential for well-being, like getting
some exercise, ensuring clean clothes, some meditation to have some
calm, and eating a healthy quick meal. Visualization also includes this
thinking through the mnemonics and of carrying out each step, and for
the memorization of those steps, and for carrying those out routinely.
My morning and evening routines have been totally abandoned since I’ve
been doing the personal form, in part because my habits already included
much that I wanted to include. I.e. I became the thing I wanted to
become and my habits were good enough to avoid having to go through the
effort of visualizing and recording on the personal form and doing the
various rituals. This is the objective of the training: to not really
need the form but to be the type of person that does all without much
effort or thought because all is habitual. Like the person who could not
go to the gym versus the person who enjoys the gym and can hardly
conceive of not going routinely.</p>
<p>However, after a period of time, some key parts of life can start to
regress, and some categories of behavior can be omitted and excessively
avoided. In my life I am feeling a need for returning to the form to get
back into a better state, particularly now that I work much less and
seem to have time free with some greater level of aimlessness. I also
engage in behaviors that are not as necessary, like working on the
computer when that is really to fill time rather than to do something
perhaps much different that is very healthful and desirable and new. So
I am returning to visualization myself and to using this form, to
rehabituate and habituate anew, beneficial behaviors. But only until I
reach a point when it is no longer necessary, and in that case I will
again stop, but will have this again to return to, in case I will need
it again.</p>
