<h2 id="introduction"><a name="introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>The purpose of this series was initially to provide various pieces of
canned messages used to overcome trolls, censors, and other people who
are not really wanting good conversation or mutual friendly development.
The initial list of canned responses were created at times I needed
actual responses to people who were harassing me, trolling me, shading
me, or were writing with bad intent, or ambiguous intent that could be
taken for bad intent.</p>
<p>I call people who are unable to engage in reasonable conversation
“human cans”, who will receive canned communications primarily. I also
call the messages “humancans”.</p>
<p>Feel free to use, modify, or share any of these humancans. Cans for
humans who do not deserve your mental processing. Premade goods.</p>
<p>For those who might not know, a “can” is simply a re-usable pre-made
thing. Canned emails, canned responses, etc… This is built off of that
idea. These are cans for humans, or humancans for responding to things
effectively without responding.</p>
<p><em>Prior Note:</em></p>
<p>I am now beginning canned responses via snippets for dealing with
tiresome problem people, and for clarifying intentions.</p>
<p>I will publish all of these on my site. Feel free to use them too,
as-is if you like. This is contrary to what is in my privacy policy, but
these snippets, marked “Social Snippet”, may be used however you like
even without any attribution.</p>

“Let’s Do Nothing”</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“Let’s do nothing.” I do think it makes sense on analysis of certain
situations, that there isn’t adequate justification for moving forward
with anyperson’s specific ideas about what others should be doing.
However, some are not even able to explore how beneficial changes might
be arrived at. I noticed through my own experience online that certain
durable traits exist in people who respond with veiled “Let’s do
nothing” comments. These are people I consider blocking or excluding,
because as we are learning we do think about what might be better in the
world, for ourselves, and if not just for ourselves, for others. For
this and other reasons I think people who block thoughts about what
might be better are not really trying to mutually benefit in
conversation. In my posts in particular, I may provide pointers that
there might be better ways, and explore better ways, but very
infrequently I’ll make concrete recommendations on societal “next
steps”. But even if I did that the infrequency of suggesting societal
next steps is not something to immediately thwart when the goal is the
invitation of intelligent conversation for mutual growth.</p>

intent is positive, and such a reaction is not. My thinking is not cold

would have a better recognition of this if the significance is known. If
the significance is not known, it is more likely there would be a
visceral reaction.”</p>

<p>“You’ve written a message to me that includes a threat or a veiled
threat. Unless you can provide a comment that indicates with good
clarity that this truly was not a threat, I will not respond to you any
further and may consider blocking or otherwise dealing with your threat,
depending on the type of threat you’ve made. This is a canned message,
or a humancan, provided to you non-uniquely, because it does not appear
mutual development or substantive comments would come from you, and
because of that, you do not deserve conversation from me, which would
likely be sophisticated and reasonable.”</p>

question, instead of using your own mind.</li>
<li>Provide a comment that is unsubstantive or rude, or trolling, or

<li>Plan to use non-unique communication not related to your own
uniqueness. I.e. reliance on traditional answers, or cultural
recollections without any reflection.</li>
<li>You are not a subject matter expert, or do not have a creative
interest in exploring the topic fallibly with uniqueness.</li>

<p>I am interested in kind, substantive and logically sensible
conversation, that is from a human mind with subject matter expertise or
willingness to explore fallibly. Fallible exploration and sharing of

having useful knowledge due to the post itself.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I’m noticing a trend in which people who appear quite intelligent in
written expression, dodge failure to understand a thesis by engaging in
semantic fault-searching. They are unable to see the meaning of the
writing and somehow remain interested, apparently for the fun of doing
something that still requires smarts–finding what could be considered
inexact in the language. Some people seek out typos, misspellings, and
grammar issues, that amount to syntactical oversights, while others look
for “blemishes” related to meaning and semantics. They often miss
creative usages, or usages intended to elucidate, and instead consider
them mistakes.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Either way paragraph and document meaning and syntax are missed,
because they lost holism and missed the main goal and thesis.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“On reading this comment it appears the reader has a view they
believe to be complete. However regarding this topic it appears the
writer is a layperson. An expert in this topic would be someone who is
called a”“, or someone who has researched to become approximately an”“,
with the added constraint that learnings relate directly to the problem.
An alternative, or in addition to this, one can gain the expertise
necessary given talents, other related experience, and research that is
suitable for a mind to bring the topic to completion. Just these do not
imply the mind has arrived at completion. One must show that analysis
and sophistication that would first indicate profundity is adequate.
This is a rarity; but even apart from the rarity, it is a stark contrast
it seems to what the reader is showing. A quality analysis would show
some understanding of math although mathematization of topics are long
and torturous; so there is some recognition that mathematization would
not be shared, but an awareness of applicable principles might be
adequate. Completeness would require that it is finished. “Intuition
backed on the mathematical method that would apply but has not been
rigorously applied” would be akin to “Leadership Judgment” that is still
better than leaderships who are available usually apply. Lastly,
complete views finalizing topics would stand up to reconsideration and
time. However, these responses seem haphazard and reactionary, and not
cool and well considered. Single links to posts that are not themselves
complete by the above criteria are not bolstered into completeness. If
you shared a link, I may look at the link and believe.</p>

<h3 id="confined-criticism"><a name="confined-criticism">Confined
Criticism</a></h3>
<p><em>Tuesday, August 17<sup>th</sup>, 2021</em>, <time>4:33 PM Las
Vegas, NV Time</time></em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“This comment appears to fail to acknowledge that writing that is
performing a function of social criticism is attempting, quite often, to
reach a solution by first identifying a problem. That is the case here
as well with this posting, even if this is not obvious. The intention
may go unrecognized but this is a key intention. Critical postings
arouse various reactions in an audience. Some will find it a challenge
and will via cognitive dissonance attempt to reinforce their views. Some
will feel the same but instead of offering a reasonable response, or a
non response, will react with emotions to create damage as if the
emotions were founded on valid thinking. Some will simply want to
consider it “negative” and create distance or do the same, even without
knowing the meaning. This might be called “cognitive dissonance of the
type: mismatching emotional preference for topic.” This would be
cognitive dissonance where the reader has a conclusion they believe to
be “positive” and if it appears different, it is still a challenge even
if the content is ignored. These people will respond reinforcing their
view by attacking without even understanding, or with understanding but
the content out of view (preferring to attend to the cognitive
dissonance issue resulting from social attitude. Additionally comments
like those above generalize. A confined act of criticism is about the
topic and not about all topics. The dissonance can elicit a range of
errored responses, and I have no desire to identify which applies,
because the reader is already required to make sense in responses. This
requires an understanding about which emotions are appropriate when,
what rules of collaborative argumentation are when there are
disagreements, and what is logical or illogical. The last requirement
can have some forgiveness because our cultures failed to teach logic.
Logic is nothing special and uses regular language but is not easy to
independently discover. However, if too illogical I will consider
communication with the reader impossible (permanently depending on the
severity). It is easy for the experienced logical of natural language to
see the issues, but they cannot be communicated to those who merely
assume they make sense with no experience, who in fact can’t make
sense.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“It is not entirely easy to determine who is trolling and who is not
because we have not found a clear definition of the term and have not
seen clear examples for identification. Here are a few examples of
trolling that lead me to believe that this is what you are doing:
Sharing a meme or video that is irrelevant but has the effect of
provocation, or goal of leading others to censure and discount a message
without additional thought, with hopes of gaining a following of
commenters taking interest in the comment over the actual posting. Goal
is to create a subthread that dominates and shadows the main thread.
Comments that are verbal and short that simply stab at the author on
grammar, on spelling errors, on typos, and other issues where the
meaning is apparent, and the intent of the writer ignored. When the
intent of my writing which is positive, clarifying, or otherwise
educational in intent is discarded on grounds that it is critical, or
other grounds that are within the normal methods of teaching and artful
thinking. This comment isn’t to expand on the conversation of what is
trolling and what isn’t. It’s merely to show how I reasonably think you
are in here as a troll. Sometimes trolling activities are ‘covered up’
by pretense of ‘genuine or honesty in reaction’, whereas in my
experience this is used to exculpate the troll and for the troll to
pretend suddenly they are not a troll, and are really trying to
contribute. Trolling in fishing is a method of catching fish and
stringing them along another direction. It’s related to ‘red herring’
too, and often has hopes of guiding more than one person off track.”</p>

for Pretended Superiority</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“Occasionally someone will read what I’ve written, clearly with the
objective of sharing something of quality, that it could have been
written more simply. Readers sometimes will, in a short statement, claim
they’ve said all that I’ve said. I’m not sure if there has ever really
been a case in which that’s been true, and think it likely not. In other
words, it has never happened. If I’ve written something lengthy, and
someone has found something of a theme, or a way to summarize much in it
simply, then I think that perceptive and acute, and maybe helpful. But
if by that one thinks they have already stated all that I think
regarding the topic, or all that I’ve already written, they would be
mistaken. In this case, I think what may be happening, is the respondent
may be wanting to pretend that my article or posting is of less value
because something of it could be summarized quickly, but that is very
far from saying, that the person has shared it themselves, and that by
summarizing, somehow some superiority is demonstrated. There is in this
kind of response some indication that what was read was determined to be
of quality, and perhaps is intimidating, and to remove any feeling of
intimidation, one can show that one already had a thought that was the
point of the whole writing, to recover from the intimidation by thinking
oneself greater, for not having learned anything new.”</p>

Insults Contra Harassers</a></h2>
<p>Somewhat often, because of my recognizability and stature, I
encounter harassers. The harassers behave somewhat like fans who are
hostile to various famous people. Like famous people bothered by
harassers, I will not always be patient and kind, or creative. Since
most are stupid, and all have bad intentions, I do not think there is
any need to provide them courtesy, or tailored treatment. Instead I’ll
uncreatively mock and insult them, in a way that I can see applies, but
done in similar ways to everyone who harasses. An objective in my life
is preserving and expanding on rationality. One way to expand on
rationality is to automate certain unwanted tasks which ought not occupy
too much thought. One really janitorial task, is simply treating people
poorly when it’s necessary in an automatic, unreflective way. If one
gets hit, it is useful to automatically hit back in effective ways, with
less reflection and not more. If patience and normal discourse is
healthful, then there may not be a need to use these humancans. I would
prefer to use the items in the first list than items in the second list,
but will use both. The second list need not be funny and can be as
offensive as you like.</p>
<p>It becomes like warfare if others are sufficiently rude and childish.
All the items below are examples. Utility depends on how and when said.
All is obtuse and that adds value since it requires less thinking.</p>
<p>There truly is a moral justification to this behavior too, and if
anyone really has standards enough to think of or say the items above,
then one may really need to automate using the items below, for not
wanting to use them <em>at all</em>. However, historically many of these
methods were employed, and all can be roughly found with some similarity
in entertainment.</p>
<p>Much more needs to be said on this topic, but a few additional points
might be made briefly:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Robiticize them by roboticizing yourself.</em> Phrases like
these against harassers make you more of a robot, and less human for
them. They are likely acting very predictably, like “canned harassers”.
Need a harasser? There could be a job for that in which all do roughly
the same. Returning automated responses that damage is useful and
roboticizes the interaction. It protects your rationality.</li>
<li><em>Elicit their childishness further, without caring.</em> Show
them they’re bad at it.</li>
<li><em>Emphasize they are a variable to you, and you really can
interchange them.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Some will claim this process is wit, but I really consider it
primitive.</p>

Stay and Negotiation Requests</a></h3>
<p>Hi AirBnB <em>Host</em>,</p>
<p>I would be interested in staying, if you can match a rate of my
normal AirBnB stays in Invercargill, in which I’ve established
relationships. I could pay $50 NZD, for tonight at first, and later
going forward, could pay that same rate for longer stays, weeks or
more.</p>
<p>I am a retiree, former executive/consultant guiding large companies
internationally, including <em>wherever I am</em>. I’m here doing other
work as a writer/author and media producer. I’m in the High Intelligence
community and am accustomed to discounted rates, due to the ease of
transactions and likelihood of a good experience (Mensa discounting,
like retirement accounting, etc…). I am a member of Mensa International
and Mensa New Zealand.</p>
<p>My website and social media resume and profiles use the alias
Mattanaw. You can use this to discover my background. Please also see my
stellar reviews.</p>
<p>I am very clean and like leaving rooms approximately how I found
them, perhaps slightly better, being someone who cleans and organizes
what I see, and it would be likely very clean and easy apart from
dressing of the beds, which makes discounting perhaps reasonable anyhow.
Being busy with my media productions and traveling swiftly I like
minimal interactions, and really enjoy being directed to my room
automatically or easily, for self service arrivals and departures.
Although certainly I like to chat if there is a paths-crossing for
conversation.</p>
<p>I am most interested in paying cash; but if that creates any
difficulty initially, I can pay here on AirBnB instead. You would simply
need to extend an offer to me in the application at the new rate of $50,
or something perhaps slightly higher if you find a negotiation
agreeable. $50 is great though as it matches my other rates
approximately and would simplify my travel plans, and would facilitate
just using the same rate for longer stays (except month long stays).</p>
<p>Let me know if you would be open to this, and I would be very happy
to stay tonight. Timeliness could mean I may book another AirBnB because
I have to search in the meantime, but if responsive this can be a quick
transaction.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Matt</p>
