<h2 id="introduction"><a name="introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>While it may be possible to read though this website and have some
understanding of the total topic, there are some demands on time and
intelligence that are insurmountable for the most if not all readers, to
come to a thorough understanding of what is being communicated. Articles
may be read individually and usefully, and I fully encourage the reader
to enjoy the various articles here published. However, this is a very
large work. It is similar to a journal, or magazine of many issues, but
there is an important difference: it is cohesive and comprehensive, and
is intended to be a synthesis of technology and planning. Like a
complete academic journal of many issues written over many years, it
will not be possible for the reader to fully understand what is shared.
Like a large and complex software solution, it cannot be expected that
an individual reader can understand it all, or the intentions of the
original authors, and architecture and plan, without additional aid and
support; and even with that support, it is not anticipated that the
primary author or architect’s mind would be known. A piece of
technology, of many pieces with distributed interrelated documentation,
may not be easily reverse-engineered, and in this case, the author
already knows it is impossible. No ready will be able to cover all the
material and the technology, and understand all that’s been presented in
synthesis.</p>
<p>This website, and document, is one that requires certification if one
wants to be able to claim more than a passing reader’s understanding of
the material, and the claims that go beyond passing reading are
controlled and owned by the author of this site. In other words, no
reader may claim to 1) know the mind of the author on the basis of what
he here freely published, 2) claim anything other than passing-reader
status with respect to what is presented. Additional more specific
claims to understanding are only achievable with certification, and are
only revealed to serious students or researchers. In this way it is akin
to what is encountered in software, since not all that the software
comprises and not all of the software sales materials, and meanings of
trainings that are sold, are known in advance of serious sales
communications. I invite people who have special interest to request
certification, and I will readily share what certification will entail
for various costs and commitments.</p>
<p>One might consider this a somewhat strange addition to this website;
but I assure the reader, this perspective is not only regular and
commonplace for all certifications of anything where the reader might
make a claim of what the author creates, it is also useful to your life,
and your handling of your own legal affairs. Consider that a reader of a
publication may be inclined to use that material to claim you think a
certain way in court. Using that material in court, they may claim that
they understand how you think apart from the article, or how you
consider it to fit in with other parts of your work, or life, or goals,
or designs. When I mention that a reader or researcher is a passing
reader by default, I mean no offense: that is what I am when I read
briefly off of someone else’s site, or publication, or if I talk to them
for a first time, or share only a few conversations with them. These
short communications have not prepared me for any special claim to
larger or total knowledge of a person’s mind, plans, designs, goals, or
total technology created.</p>
<p>Consider the proposed organizational process below. This was a
strategic process option recommendation for a large international
corporation for the management of its digital assets. Such a
technological process is a group behavior process that would firstly be
considered business confidential and proprietary, and secondly, would be
corporate intellectual property that is hoped to bring competitive
advantages to the business, and add profitability impacting
shareholders. Someone from the public would not simply be allowed to
learn this process, its significance, its business context, and the so
on. This process relates to how jobs are preformed, and the specific
tasks that would be carried out by new hires fulfilling specific job
functions, partly defined by this and other documents. Within
technology, and various business professions, certification is required
to show sufficient proficiency for those candidates who may be hired, or
those internal candidates who would want to convey later, a
transferrable skill. Particularly if the process fits within a software
solution that is used elsewhere. Learning about the software would cost
money in education expense, and it would be gate-kept information only
available to serious candidates or those who spent funds to learn (or
had organizations spend funds on their behalf). In this way a
certification of a piece of technology relating to behaviors of
individuals singly and collectively is normalized in our culture. For
this reason it can be understood, again, that a site such as this, which
is a piece of technology and a book and journal, would require special
school-teaching to arrive at an adequate understanding that would be
certifiable. Such teachings protect a business in their ability to
control their brand, in that no person who has not attained
certification, or adequate teaching, can claim to have mastery.
Otherwise anyone from the public could claim to have mastery of software
solutions and business professional practices that are used for hiring
people who are expected by businesses in the industry to actually have
those skills, and some expectations regarding the authority of the
cerification that would have been granted by the teaching organization.
A person cannot speak on behalf of an organization’s educational content
without having obtained and learned that content in a way approved by
that organization.</p>

<p><em>Figure 1. Real proprietary business process impacting an
organization and its roles and employees, and training and educational
materials and potentially certification.</em></p>
<p><br /><img  class="ui huge center image transition visible" data-src="02012023065421-microsoft-certification-mattanaw-1-source.jpg" src="02012023065421-microsoft-certification-mattanaw-1-source.jpg"><br /></p>
<p><em>Figure 2. Certification program relating to a job role, which
would include proprietary training materials such as work process
diagrams, best practices, and other documents used for creating
skills.</em></p>
<p>I personally am not an advocate of all forms of cerfication, and much
prefer open information which would enable people to learn in a way that
is supposedly part of the discipline of science. This site is an open
site, and I do not think others would not benefit from learning freely.
However, they cannot speak for me, as someone cannot speak for a brand,
if they have not been certified. They cannot be trusted to speak about
what I would say, do, and think, regarding my own material here, without
such a certification. Learnings would be too incomplete due to
complexity.</p>
<p>This is a technology solution and not only a writing, but as a
writing it is also complex and interrelated, and very large (at present
well over 300,000 words), and for this reason it is necessary to protect
from pretend experts of the material. I am willing to extend expertise
to the reader if the reader is willing to invest in getting certified.
However, almost all material is shared already on this site, so I do not
want to dissuade the reader from reading freely, from all that has been
provided.</p>
<p>This is not a work of religion but does replace religion, and is a
religion in a legal sense, in that it replaces all that religion might
do, for me. However, there is no superstition, or false promises of
things that cannot be provided or are unreal. Religions are not freely
available as some might claim, for gaining any level of accepted or
authenticated understanding which allows someone to claim expertise. One
must attend a theological seminary, or follow other avenues of
hierarchical advancement, somewhat akin to exposure in other fields of
work, and in education/academia, for finally being accepted or entitled,
or given an elevated position of employment, which amount to formal and
informal certifications.</p>
<p>This writing is akin to an honest and truthful founding of a
religion, creating of a technology for life, an alternative moral
system, a technology for mind publication, and for life taxonomy, and
much more… It includes software, business processes, intellectual
property, personal life processes, academic articles, technology
designs, blended in a method of communication, on a software solution
entirely created by the author. Software solutions are protected as
being original designs but includes also all the site content.</p>
<p>If a reader wants to have some credibility more than a passive
reader, like in obtaining employment in a specific position, or
attaining a role in a church organization, or other religion, or getting
certified for a specific controlled technology (even if available), or
having a degree in a college, or having a diploma at a school, or
showing mastery by taking a standard test, it is necessary to get
certified.</p>
<h2 id="legal-limitations"><a name="legal-limitations">Legal
Limitations</a></h2>
<p>This living autobiography, life, website, book and journal, log, and
so on, also has some <a href="terms-conditions.txt">terms and
conditions</a>, and a <a href="privacy-policy.txt">privacy
statement</a>, which incorporates contract law in a way that may not
itself be easily understood without explanation and certification. But
the author doesn’t rely only on the terms and conditions to explain his
behavior and position with respect to the law, including justifications
of what here is written and its meaning, and position of what is written
in relation to the law. Since this site is a living autobiography, it
includes content which is more directly related and resulting from, and
evidence of, the author’s behavior and his actual life, that is informed
by this work since he actively uses it. This work is the result of his
life and is part of his life, and in feedback loops informs his life.
His legal justifications of his behavior, or legal rationales for his
behavior, where they exist, occur as he thinks about what he will do,
and is included within his automatic behavior in his habits.</p>
<p>The terms and conditions and privacy policy, have been artificially
separated from life content and other writings on this website. It is
important to know that legal content exists in the rest of the sites
content. This implies that the terms and conditions, and privacy policy,
are not the only legal materials here, and that the entire site must be
surveyed in order to locate and understand all the legal positions the
author has, that are disclosed and inform his behavior, and might be in
his behavior, and in his thinking. The certification program provides
additional information which would allow for better interpretation of
the author’s legal commitments, access to legal writings, and
opportunity to survey all the legal materials which have relevance to
understanding the author’s thinking.</p>
<p>Even the certification program, however, is insufficient for
conveying to others the author’s legal position in its entirety, and
since there is so much legal content to survey, it is unlikely that
anyone who obtains certification will have time needed to covney the
same information to another. The implication is that certification would
be insufficient to provide the person certified wtih witness testimony
that is adequate to relay to another person, who has not had a
certification, and is uncertified, the knowledge required to
understand.</p>
<p>The author thinks it unfortunate that legal contracts are so lengthy
and numerous in any individual’s life experience. Legal relationships
that are not really possible to “opt out”, meaning they are forced,
include also contracts which one must agree to, that are not possible to
understand or read thoroughly, such that full understanding is possible.
Taken in conjunction, all the legal relationships had provably have
legal contracts with legal documents in tens of thousands of pages for
any individual. It is not the author’s intention to create contracts
with readers or potential students or people wanting certification. The
above paragraphs are intended to provide the reader an understanding
that the legal position of the author requires even more than this
unfortunately, for obtaining a full knowledge of the author’s legal
position, outside of having contracts with the author. Any particular
business may require one to have a legal contract, signed, for a service
that is really necessary, like cellular phone communication or internet
connectivity, which may have many thousand words of text written by
trained lawers coming from a law school. Mattanaw, who is a pro-se
attorney and experienced litigant, has done more to explain his own
legal position, by interspersing legal information in his website within
his autobiography, this Book and Journal, numbering in the thousands of
pages, and hundreds of thousands of words. Soon there will be over a
million words, with legal material provided, in context for its proper
interpretation, within Mattanaw’s life and life recordings.</p>
<p>Mattanaw’s legal position can only be understood within the context
of his life, and so it is natural that legal documents and content
expressing his legal position would appear in context for interpretation
to be possible. The entire Book and Journal is an evidence submission,
or exhibit submission, which would need to be completely read by a court
system, to obtain a level of understanding which is required, but not
good enough for certification. Legal reading is not a substitute for
certification, which requires payment. This would provide additional
information as to the value of certification, for providing more
training than what is obtainable by a court system or judge. In a way
this resembles all education. A court system cannot understand science,
for not having been educated scientifically in a university setting.
Likewise, a complex life cannot be understood, without dedicated study
of that life. In this case, the study of the life of the author exceeds
in quantity and quality what is provided in a university education! Due
to limitations on reading and reading comprehension, and also quality of
information provided by the university itself! Not having content enough
to share on its own to provide its certifications (degrees), it relies
mostly on the writings of others, from other, usually better,
universities.</p>
<h2 id="program-details"><a name="program-details">Program
Details</a></h2>
<p>More details on specifics of the program that can be shared in
advance of getting notified of serious interest will be provided
soon.</p>
<p>For now, what can be said is the starting program is roughly as
indicated below, and costs $250,000 USD.</p>
<p>Additional materials and time from the author are part of this
commitment to more seriously become knowledgeable with this system,
beyond what is provided on this website.</p>
<p>The author would like to work with readers who are interested, but
being realistic, there are risks to the author. The author, in a similar
capacity to an employer, has final discretion concerning who might be
admitted or worked with for certification. Like a university, initially
there are safety considerations. Following safety considerations, are
other risks. Finally there is time and available resources which would
justify expenditure. I care about consumerism, and I want anyone who
spends resources to have plenty provided in return.</p>

<li>Please summarize the author’s meaning, in your estimation, of one

not appear to get close as to the author’s meaning, reading materials,
the reader claims to have been interested in. I.e. caring about

<h2 id="value"><a name="value">Value</a></h2>
<p>On initially announcing this certification program, a few in my
network were somewhat curious about what could be of value in this
program. The reader should not be confused, as there are definite
tangible values of this program.</p>
<ul>
<li>Insurance payout if I die before completion.</li>
<li>Professional Reference, from someone who has had a very successful
career.</li>
<li>Letters of Reference, for various objectives that might be had.</li>
<li>Professional mentoring regarding career strategy, and direct
support.</li>
<li>Certification as to the participants quality of life direction, in
detail.</li>
<li>Unreleased materials. Materials additional to those provided to
other on this site.</li>
<li>Software related training, where interested.</li>
<li>Technology related training, where interested.</li>
<li>Industry secrets of value.</li>
<li>Work and education related support, direction, mentoring.</li>
<li>Extremely honest, but caring feedback, in keeping with standards of
Psychological Practice.</li>
<li>Lack of seriousness about certification. “I’m certified” is not
something the author values much. Rather, more concrete gains on
livelihood and respect are preferred.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is believed that the professional reference alone may be worth the
entire certification, but the author thinks there is no question the
others and more additionally fully and completely overtake participant
expenditures.</p>
<h2 id="price"><a name="price">Price</a></h2>
<p>The current price for this certification program is:</p>
<p>$250,000 USD</p>
