<h2 id="introduction"><a name="introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>Most are aware that in our calendaring system for tracking and
planning days, years, and months, that there are imperfections that have
caused us to need to add an extra day every four years for what has been
called the leap year. The cause for our addition of an extra day every
fourth February is to account for the fact that a solar year is not
really 365 days, but is 365 and approximately a quarter days. To fix
this issue, we simply add one year every four years, to make a periodic
adjustment. Watch makers making fine automatic luxury watches are aware
that a year is not precisely even 365 and one quarter days, but is only
nearly 365 and one quarter, meaning that additional adjustments are
needed after some larger number of days. Their watches were designed to
keep time even more precisely to function and show dates correctly, even
after some hundred years have elapsed.</p>
<p>We have not come far regarding the solution of the calendaring for
universal understanding of the true duration of a solar year, to make it
unnecessary to have adjustments after four years, and after longer
periods of time; and if we look more precisely still at the length of
the solar calendar year, going to very high precision into the millions
of digits, we’ll see that more adjustments will be needed for even
greater periods of elapsed time. Our calendar, only adjusting every four
years, is a basic calendar, and is only the third or fourth advancement
in calendaring. Other calendars have existed in the past that are more
inaccurate than our present calendar, but it must be admitted that the
present calendar is certainly not that advanced, although it does work
well for our normal planning and tracking of days, weeks, months and
years.</p>
<p>Here we solve the calendaring problem permanently into the future, so
that there is no longer any need to continue to devise new calendars
with greater sophistication. What is offered here is a permanent
solution. It is the author’s view that imaginative attempts to resolve
the calendar were still too committed to concepts such as the week and
the month, and this is related to a desire to incorporate other older
interests in moon phases and structuring of days into seven day weeks,
and months resembling earlier ideas about what a month consists of.</p>
<h2 id="the-calendar-solved-1"><a name="the-calendar-solved">The
Calendar Solved</a></h2>
<p>In my work as a software architect, and in my work doing
sophisticated personal planning on paper, I recognized eventually that
our calendar software appears complex but relies on very simplistic
underlying structure. The calendar shows to you days, weeks, and months
in a familiar way resembling earlier printed calendars we have all seen
and are familiar with. Calendars on paper and in software are shown to
us with grid-like visuals. We have months that have a table structure,
or grid of squares, that is seven wide for all days in a seven day week,
and other days beneath. The number of days in a particular month control
the size of each calendar grid. When all pages in a print calendar are
taken together for a 12 month period we have a sequence of month pages,
or month grids, that show a total of one year. Typically a print
calendar will focus on just one year, with a month or two of previous
and future months showing, to give us time to switch from one print
calendar to another. In software we have a similar approach, and when we
use date-selection tools for planning trips with airlines, hotels, and
car rentals, we switch between the grid-months in a way that is not
unlike flipping through pages of a printed calendar. Users of the
calendar systems then feel like they immediately know how to use the
software, from prior exposure to similar calendar tools, and from
experience of the print calendar. Soon it may turn out that all will use
the software calendar instead of print calendars, and already it is
somewhat rarer to see calendar booklets. But at present all know how to
use the calendar from familiarity with both, and definitely all have
been trained in school using booklet calendars.</p>
<p>There were a few insights required to arrive at the finished solution
to the calendaring problem. Firstly, that the underlying structure used
by all calendars is really not a grid, but a list. I’ve used a text list
in the past for my own calendaring purposes. One can think of the list
calendar as simply showing a list of days numbered from one to 365 for a
normal year. These are then split into months, but for that one simply
“chunks” the list into months with the number of days that each month
has. So days one through thirty would be January. February first, would
be on day 31, and you could really use the number 31 for the year
instead of using February 1. But for convenience one can simply start
writing February’s days on day 32 of the year. It is not strange to
realize that every day of a particular month is still an N<sup>th</sup>
day in a year. For any day of any month you can know which day in the
year it is, numbered from one to 365. Weeks, like months, simply go onto
the list. The same is true for day-names, like Sunday, Monday and
Tuesday. Once you’ve written out the list, you have a calendar in list
format that is identical with the normal grid-calendar. One could use
only this type of text calendar for one’s planning and tracking of days.
This is the first insight required, that the calendar can simply be a
list of days.</p>
<p>Secondly, one must become aware that days really are an unarbitrary
division required for planning. Animal life has become cyclical
according to changes of day and night that relate to rotations of the
earth. Normal human planning and functioning relies on cycles of
earth-rotations, for healthful sleep and daytime activities, and one’s
biology actually has become what it is because of human biological
development over many thousands of years of the earth rotating. It is
unarbitrary to use days and one expects to use days to track time. Days
cannot be omitted to use only time. We need days to retain normal
planning. Likewise, days are real, and correspond to a real physical
cycle. A day really is the rotation of the earth and has a beginning and
end. It is known that the length of the day is also lengthening, as the
earth’s rotation slows down. But even with the change, the day is still
what is required for normal human planning, and not only for normal
human planning. Animals use day and night to plan their behavior, and
their behavior also is what it is, because of their life on a rotating
earth.</p>
<p>Thirdly, while the day is unarbitrary and necessary, the month is
not. We use month’s partly to track seasons, but the length of months
are not coextensive with seasons. Furthermore, seasons are not the same
on different places on earth. The month is closer to a relic from the
lunar calendar. We are familiar with months and like to use them, and
since all are aware of months, everyone has very little issue
communicating about plans using months. But we could eliminate months
easily from a new calendaring system. We could have four months, one for
each season, with approximately 91.5825 days per month. This would allow
us to preserve a sense of seasonal change, in a way more clear than is
presently done, but it must still be admitted, that we don’t have the
same seasons in different locations on earth. We introduce a
regional-cultural bias in choosing to have months that correspond to
seasons, because we would make the choice like we did historically, to
use the season’s in a richer location in one part of the northern
hemisphere, like in Europe, to decide for everyone else. The calendar
would make the most sense in Europe with such a decision. But then in
other regions it would make little sense. We experience such an issue
when we celebrate holidays like Christmas, with winter themes, in
December, making it strange for others to try to celebrate similarly in
the Southern Hemisphere, in places where it may be summer. We could fix
this issue by having different calendars for different regions, but
since this reveals that the choice is arbitrary, or relative to region,
and that we want a single calendar, the author instead chose an
unarbitrary solution for everyone that works everywhere. This solution
is one that is more natural and is unarbitrary, and not relative to
regions. Instead it is more respectful to the various regions and
cultures around the world, and uses a system that everyone can use, that
doesn’t prefer one single richer region in the northern hemisphere, in
Europe for example.</p>
<p>Fourthly, it must be noticed that the method of correcting for the
extra quarter day for every year, by making a ‘leap year’, seems a
too-simple solution, and one that creates a strangeness, in that it is
known that there is not an extra day every four years, but an extra
quarter day every year. This creates a sense that the leap year is
false, and that the years leading to the leap year are false too.
Really, each year is the same. Since each year is the same, what can we
do to make them all the same?</p>
<p>A solar year, like a normal day, is unarbitrary and real. Like the
earth rotates once over and over, really the earth does go around the
sun over and over, and this rotation matters for our lives and planning,
and for understanding of the timing of the seasons at all places on
earth. The year really has a consistent time. The rotation of the earth
around the sun is slowing, but very imperceptibly. It is consistently
and reliably about the same amount of time every year, and that is very
near to 365.25 days. If we measure very precisely, with millions of
digits, we will understand it is changing, and that it is not exactly
365.25 days. But a single rotation really is a single rotation, and it
does happen every year, and we define a year by this rotation. We can
measure it very precisely. It cannot be omitted from our calendar, and
it is very useful to us. It is natural and unarbitrary, both
instrumentally, and scientifically regarding regularity of cycles.</p>
<p>Fifthly, then we have the combination of insights of what is really
unarbitrary and natural, and that is the unarbitrariness and usefulness
of both days and years. Combined with the knowledge that day names,
weeks, and months are arbitrary and not totally required for usefulness,
they can be omitted from our new calendar solution. We can combine this
with our first insight that the calendar is a simple list, to see we can
have an even more simple list, of just days and years. But there is one
additional insight required, that I don’t think others have had, from my
history of listening and attending to ideas about the calendar. This is
what I’ll explain next.</p>
<p>The year does not need to be marked the same every year, as happening
right at the end of the 365<sup>th</sup> day, which is December 31st. At
the very end of the year, when we celebrate the new year, there is
already a strange confusion, that the new year would be at night, at
different places on earth. When the earth completes a rotation around
the sun, it has finished that rotation around the sun at the same time
for everyone on earth. We have to decide when that is exactly too. Is
that when the center of the earth has passed a point around the sun, or
when the edge of the earth has passed a point around the sun. Either
way, we choose one point. The earth is one object. Once the entire ball
of the earth has circled the sun, it has finished when one spot has
reached the finish. This means the new year has begun for everyone on
earth and not one at a time, for 24 different time zones. It was always
strange that one person celebrating the new year, could call a friends
someplace else on earth, acting as though the year was not the same! The
other strange part was that since the year is not 365 days, but 365 and
a quarter days, that it would end on the very end of the
365<sup>th</sup> day.</p>
<p>The solution to this is simply to change years when the year has
really changed. This makes days the fundamental cycle to use for our
calendar. We count days until we have really gone around the sun
totally, and change our year, all at once, when the year has changed. So
on the 366th day, one quarter of the way through, we all celebrate, at
the same time, the new year. Doing it this way we can see we are all
brought together, to celebrate correctly, all at once, the new year, in
a way that is entirely correct and unarbitrary, and natural. It is the
same for everyone on earth, and every year is the same, the correct
length of a circling of the sun, of 365 and one quarter day, with any
additional precision desired. We can exactly change years every year to
the millions of digits of precision. We can even account for changes in
lengths of years. Notice the earth’s rotation is independent of the
rotation of the earth around the sun, and if we count days, we can make
small movement of the years, and simply place them on days accurately.
So the new year would be celebrated at a very slightly different time
every year.</p>
<p>It may take some time to reflect, but this really is a complete
solution. Even as we count years, and decades, we do need to know the
days that have happened from when we started counting, but the years
only need to fall someplace on the list of days with regularity. The
result of doing it this way would not be a strange calendar as one might
think. Since days and years are so uniform, it would hardly change
anything at all. The end of the year would still happen exactly as
expected at the same time, but it would be more precise and not less.
There would be no strange leap years. The year would always be the same
length to our human perceptions. We know scientifically it varies
slightly, but that change is so slow that our human perceptions could
ignore it, but still learn about it. This way all are smarter about the
calendar too.</p>
<p>In the next ten years, we will have 3650 days. Each year will finish
on the 365.25 day, and it will be that way through all our lives, and
through the lives of many generations afterwards. But it is also a
complete solution until the end of the earth.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><a name="conclusion">Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>Thus in conclusion we arrived at a natural calendar that is maximally
unarbitrary and parsimonious. By parsimonious what is meant is that it
does not include any extras that are not needed, and that it includes
exactly what is required. The sense of the use of this calendar is that
it is a true calendar. This provides additional substantiation that it
is the calendar that we would most want to use, after thinking it
through completely.</p>
<p>The reader should consider that the author has recognized the related
topic of time keeping. Time is currently kept according to days. Days
change, and so in the distant future, there is something wrong with
time. Time has to be related also to something that changes less. But
for the calendaring solution there is no such need as to fix this. We
rely on day rotations more than we rely on an idea of perfect
time-keeping. We have chosen our time-keeping using days. We rotate our
times using days. But like our list of days used to determine calendars,
we <em>could</em> have a list of times connected to another more
constant source of relation. If we were to make that change, however, it
would appear more arbitrary, and less natural. That is how important the
daily cycle is, that even if we could choose another timekeeping method,
it would appear less related to our lives. The regularity of days can be
used to calibrate time, to have a separate system of timing even while
we use our normal method. There are decisions to be made there but they
are about scientific precision and this is less relevant to calendaring
in a way that is useful. Additional reflection will reveal that this
calendaring solution is extremely complete. The author has to provide
some statements such as this considering time so the reader is aware
that the author is not often overlooking things of importance, and to
share with the reader that certain observations about possible mistakes
are not actually observations about what has not been thought of or not
considered. Instead the author should be recognized for having already
appreciated certain perceived limitations the reader might notice. The
author has noticed them and this is the cause for arriving at the
correct solution.</p>
<p>This calendar also reveals that we do not so much need to depend on
calendaring software solutions that might appear complex. Instead it
should be recognized that they provide us very little. What is used for
planning is a list of days, that can be simply represented in plain
text. The mutual collaborative planning of days with events, via email,
simply updates textual shared calendars. This should reveal to the
reader that software providers can pretend to provide solutions that are
very sophisticated while asking in return for too much personal
information or money. It is anticipated the others could use this
information to create extremely simple calendar solutions that cost very
little to develop that could be used by anyone. It should be noticed
that all calendaring solutions do the same work, yet each provider of
the calendar solution, while knowing about the simplicity of the
solution, wants you to commit to using theirs. But truly there is very
little special provided that would require any commitment. Instead
habits are relied upon for having a customer relationship that continues
for a period of time that’s too long, or creates issues for switching to
new solutions. One could write one’s own list of days quickly and
maintain one’s own calendar, even simply writing down who might attend
events, and place the result in a location that all can see. More is
wanted for an automatic solution, but already the print calendar and
communication was effective, otherwise we would not value our
governments. They did all they did without software calendars.</p>
<p>This completes the search for new types of calendars and there is no
need to name such calendars with the names of individuals. Historical
calendars have had the names of different ancient leaders. We could call
this the “Mattanawian Calendar”, or the “Wanattomian Calendar”, given
the author’s other efforts, but the author thinks this absurd. There is
no calendar ownership and it is too simple to name. We can simply call
the complete calendar the calendar. Some temporary acknowledgement to
the author is desirable, but there is no special need to always say
“Mattanaw” anytime the calendar is mentioned in discussion about what is
the best calendar. Instead this solution is just a historical detail in
the history of calendar making.</p>
