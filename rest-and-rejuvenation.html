<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>In order to ensure that I had adequate rest and rejuvination, in my
early twenties, I worked to achieve early retirement. The objective of
earning early retirement was not to be lazy, or refrain from doing any
work whatsoever. Instead, it was a method of getting out of working in a
career that was disconnected from my interests for too long. Certain
types of creative work simply do not pay well, and this is well
understood. If attending college, one might wonder if one’s chosen
pathway and degree would actually be one that is high paying and
rewarding enough to make one feel satisfied in a profession, and outside
a profession. When I started college, I did Psychology and Philosophy,
both of which had poor prospects for earnings over the life span.
Deliberately with the goal of getting the freedom necessary to pursue my
own creative intersts, in a variety of disciplines known to not pay well
(art for example), I chose to temporarily work in the field of
computing. This field was known to itself permit greater freedoms and
also paid extremely well for the work performed. Within such a field, I
thought, I could save enough to do later what I really wanted to do with
my time. Rather than be a writer or artist who depended on someone with
wealth to donate or procure works that would become in their interest,
rather in their own interests, I wanted to use my own savings to keep
time open for me to do my work in my own vision.</p>
<p>This work here is actually a product of my success in making that
happen for me.</p>
<p>I do not get paid for this work, and other related projects, which
I’ve kept up even during my work in my career over the years. Today this
is nearly my exclusive interest, to engage in my own productions and to
publish them here.</p>
<p>Leisure time is necessary for the development of certain hobbies and
interests, which we separated from professional life because we cannot
earn from them. This does not mean that the efforts are not genuine
work. They can be more passionate efforts that are more desired and
worthy, but not necessarily those that will earn a living. So in my
vision of retirement, I have freedom to do those things an aristocrat or
a rich person would be able to do their entire lives, and it includes
much effort and work that is rewarding. This is the benefit of wealth is
having time to do what one wants to do and not what one feels one has to
do for someone else.</p>
<p>In my life there is plenty of time for rest and rejuvenation. My goal
in this category has been achieved, even without much attention to this
category. I had awareness about this category as I worked on my
livelihood, which included career considerations and financial
savings.</p>
<p>My interest in rest and rejuvenation today relates more to my cycles
and shifts (calendar) category, in that I’m now separating from the view
that one should have a set amount of sleep on a daily basis, and that
the career expectations and daily/weekly work expectations have any
relation at all to what is restorative biologically. Instead, I think
now that my sleep cycle differs from convention and is more informed by
what was natural as a child than what was forced in school and in work
life. I am now focusing on what makes me feel restored, which seems to
include quite a lot more sleep. I’ll sleep 12 hours a day and feel no
issue about it. Instead, it seems more restorative and not less. But I
don’t count the hours I sleep, and I don’t state “on average I sleep x
amount per day every day, per week, etc…” These are part of the same
issue of “You should get 8 hours of sleep per day” which doesn’t appear
to have any scientific basis, and certainly is not true over the
lifespan, for everyone.</p>
<p>My interest is now in countering what I consider to be poor teaching
in the population. My background in Psychology informs that common
expectations on rest are that of laypeople relying on the media, and not
on science at all. People, including myself, have been ready to think of
themselves as depressed without any basis other than going by a feeling
of wanting sleep and rest, which in my view now is totally permissible.
In myself it is cyclical the amount of sleep I want. As a child, I
recall sleeping as much as I wanted without any feeling that I would be
categorized in a pathological way. If I was more energetic for a period,
perhaps because of sports, which happen seasonally, suddenly I would
want much more sleep. I remember sleeping on many occasions after
arriving home from school and sleeping until the next day, from about 4
p.m. to 7 a.m., which is about 21 hours. It was restorative, and quite
nice. Exhaustion feels good and sleeping extra does not indicate one is
depressed. It is also cyclical because sporting is scheduled in a
cyclical and seasonal way. As an adult, however, one suddenly departs
from these types of cycles and is expected to work 40 hours per week, 8
hours per day, which is simply 1/3 of 24 hours, over years as if seasons
don’t exist and change behavioral alterations that would result in sleep
differences. It is simply an easy number arrived at that has very little
significance other than ensuring that pay is consistently a similar
amount, and that a certain amount of potential work is available for an
employer. 8 hours of work has no connection at all with the required
amount of sleep, but oddly, the amount of sleep recommended matches the
workday, which I do not think is coincidental.</p>
<p>My perspective on the calendar has changed as a result of these
considerations. Retired life makes it possible to self-experiment
without any supposed obligations or responsibilities to work 8 hours a
day during the time of greatest energy and creativity. I am exploring
changes with my approach to rest and rejuvenation which is now very
different from that which is accepted in our-your culture.</p>
<p>Even while working in my career I considered it an extreme absurdity
that one would only receive a week or two of vacation a year. In order
to avoid that ridiculous limitation of work, I changed jobs to ones that
would allow for more flexibility and more time off, and would be
forceful in my requiring of my employer time off in exchange for
performing vastly above what was required. “You are doing a good job but
you get two weeks of vacation” is not a reward for doing a good job. It
is falsely saying “thank you” and then saying “I’m not giving you more”.
When I was working, I wanted no less than quarterly weeks off. 4 weeks
off a year at a minimum, and I would use every sick day provided even if
not sick. I would also be willing to take time off without pay.</p>
<p>Today, however, most days are days off, or vacation days, but I think
back to work and still get somewhat aggravated by the control employers
and managers exert without any rational justification. Then in places
like the United States, and Western World, people act as though they are
running their government and coporations, but they have no control at
all on their vacation time, hours of work, and they’ve come to believe
their sleep should match the duration of their daily work. Rest and
rejuvenation, and how we treat that topic, really reveals much falsity
in how our lives are organized from outside. One need not work 40 hours
a week every week. Output is not related to hours so much as people
think, across workforces. Weeks can vary in how much work is performed.
In agriculture, the same work would not exist over the year, but again,
would occur in different kinds of cycles. 40 hours a week for a year
completely ignores various types of ecological and biological cycles: <a

<p>There are things most people can do to get out of the need to follow
these rules and customs, but it actually does seem to require doing
those things I did, or having similar interests to the ones I had. For
example, one can choose to live very frugally, and potentially minimize
any growth of a family of dependants. One can try to choose a career
with the greatest prospects on earnings that is most amenable to one’s
interests and abilities. I don’t like computing all that much, but it
did fit well with my skills and other goals I had, and my need for
interdisciplinary explanations of my life figuring into my moral system.
But I could easily weld and achieve similar results. One then saves and
accumulates until one can survive a long while with low expenditures,
achieved via practiced discipline in frugality. Today I have a savings
that may not even be necessary given I can live easily on very little.
“Financial freedom” is something possible to almost everyone but one
does really need to live without any other dependents and with some
savings, and ability to live on less, and perhaps want less.
Additionally, this can be done while expanding travels and other
interests which increase freedom and do not diminish it.</p>
<p>Another absurdity of interest is that people think they need
salvation in this context. They think they have absurd needs relating to
an afterlife, which will give final relief. This is plainly ridiculous,
as life can be very easy with planning, and one can have much relief and
rejuvenation to feel rested beginning to end, with few deviations during
times of increased difficulty. In my estimation, life is very easy. With
a reasonable plan, it is not difficult at all, even during times of
supposed challenges. However, one can make it hard enough to dream of
salvation in an afterlife, for not having a good time this life. This is
readily achievable by following a bad system of ethics, and religious
systems are definitely very poor systems, if they can be called
systems.</p>
<p>My motto these days is “Life is easy for me. Hard for you.”</p>
<p>Rest and rejuvenation has been duly reduced in importance and
deprioritized in my life categories because the work has been achieved
and I can rest as much as I like, and I have few difficulties that would
make me not experience comfort and ease routinely, on a cycle.</p>
