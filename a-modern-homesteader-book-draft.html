<p><em>[NOTE: It is anticipated that this will be entirely rewritten.
This is a first draft. Images need recovery, so only placeholders are
showing for the moment and likely they would be replaced.]</em></p>
<p>Whenever I choose to do something with my life, it is usually because
of a wide assortment for reasons. It’s always been challenging for me,
because of this, to answer any question that might be posed to me, in a
leading way, that I should have some simple, isolated, individual reason
for doing anything.</p>
<p>“Why did you move to Alaska?”</p>
<p>This is not an easy question for me to answer, because of my style of
thinking, and my approach to making life choices. My uncle understood
this and felt this way sometimes too, and had a memorable statement that
explains my position succinctly, which I can’t recall exactly in his
words, but were very close to “Are you ready to read the book on this
subject?”</p>
<p>A simple choice often has a lot behind it, and for myself, very
often, there is no single reason to be found. To say there is a single
reason, feels really disingenuous and incomplete. When I’m required to
explain myself in that way, I usually feel like I’m not really telling
the truth. I’m not really sharing my rationale for doing what I did, but
instead I’m telling someone what they’re hoping to hear.</p>
<p>That’s what this book is, to a large extent. This statement my uncle
used to make, about how much information is required for him to really
explain something to someone, is a good answer to why a book is really
necessary about my recent experiences, striving to live like a modern
homesteader, in a home in Anchorage, Alaska, amidst unwelcoming
neighbors.</p>
<p>Initiallly, I had no intention to write a full lenghted book. This
book is due, in large measure, to a strange opportunity presented at
just the right time, as I was facing legal difficulties, involving an
attempt, by my neighbors, to take part of my property for public access,
in creation of a trail to Chugach State Park, here in Anchorage, Alaska.
I was approached by a man Eric Koester, a professor at Georgetown
University, to see if I would be interested in joining a group he was
putting together, in a program of his, designed to enable people to
publish for the first time. As a professor, he told me, he wanted his
students to have the chance to walk away from courses with something
real, and tangible, and not just a grade. I found this compelling, and
agreeable, and not knowing much else, I decided to pursue it.</p>
<p>This opportunity was serendipitous, in a huge number of ways, because
firstly, I was already working on producing a book on Moral Philosophy,
in a life-long project, I started with deliberate intention about twenty
years earlier; and secondly, I was in the middle of a legal case that
was of considerable importance, and was stuck representing myself,
needing to build a story to enable myself to properly argue my case
along a factual storyline, which is not an easy task, especially in this
case, due to the complexity of the situation. I as already floundering
to find the right approach to tell my complete side of the story. Even
though I was already busy running my own business, and taking classes
for my Master’s degree at Harvard University, and was quite stressed
from being harassed around Anchorage, and socially ostracised for a
number of reasons, and was facing unexpected financial difficulties, I
nevertheless accepted the opportunity, feeling that I needed to, both to
continue my own personal mission, but also to protect myself
legally!</p>
<p>So the primary driver of this book was to write a story that I could
then use in court to explain my side of the case, which to that point
went completely unrecognized and misunderstood, by a range of parties in
Anchorage, including neighbors of some repute, and politicians,
including several State Representatives/Senators, Assembly Members,
their children, and the Mayor and Municipal Attorney. This case is still
in progress as I bring this edition of the book to completion. Needless
to say then, this book is not merely about legal protection. I found
that would be a mostly boring story, with assistance from my Editor
Cassandra Casswell, who offered very helpful guidance. For a long time I
was hesitant about having an editor assist me in my writing, especially
in relation to my work on Moral Philosophy. But this entire process, and
her support, encouraged me to adopt another point of view, that almost
any book of high quality involves numerous parties, and without their
help, it is really hard to make something that really has a professional
level of quality. I’m not sure I would even tell the same story without
her help, and actually, she was involved in law herself so had some
interesting tidbits to offer there, and not only in improving my writing
quality.</p>
<p>My entire story is important for the development of my legal case,
not just the current situation. I had neighbors who wondered about my
intentions moving into town, which meant I had to find a way to talk
about where I was from, why I wanted to relocate thousands of miles, and
why I bought the property I did, and what I wanted to do with it. I
didn’t feel they deserved this information, but since I have to go to
trial, and explain my position, it will be important to convey the type
of person I am and where I was coming from.</p>
<p>For this reason and other reasons, I decided to take an alternative
course. Why not write about my overall goal in life up to that point,
and why I wanted it to culminate, to a degree, with a transition to a
life of semi-retirement in Alaska? Why not talk a bit about moral
philosophy, my approach to a frugal lifestyle, my love of nature, and
most importantly, my transition to a life off grid, living in an RV, and
eventually, my final homestead.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, I was having a difficult time. But I have
been fortunate enough to have an extremely unorthodox and eclectic life,
and largely experienced all that I planned, and was ready to share my
experiences with others, who might want the same kinds of things as I
always did. That being said, I also have many other goals and plans, and
wanted to share those as well, to perhaps inspire readers to see all
that might be possible, and try the same things themselves, perhaps with
less hesitation, and with a realistic view of what obstacles might be
faced.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the book here is now effectively a memoir with many
stories and situations that would benefit the reader who wants to live
an alternative lifestyle. Hopefully some will be inspired to try new
things, and take some measured risks, while dodging some of the
obstacles and difficulties that I faced in my journey.</p>
<p>When my wife and I chose to relocate, the primary goal was to be
living unbothered in a beautiful and pristine environment, mostly free
of debt, with few needs, and the flexibility to work remotely whenever
there might be a need or desire to do so. I wanted to be retired early,
living the now familiar dream that most tiny-house owners aspire to. But
things did not turn out as expected, and while I’m close to living this
way, I have a ways to go. I ended up getting divorced unexpectedly, and
this caused me personal grief and resulted in a severe reduction in both
my savings and income.. Now I’m a single man, trying to find a way to
enjoy my newfound freedom, while fulfilling my dreams without my
lifelong companion I thought I would have with me.</p>
<p>So there are problems where I expected none. Suddenly, I’m doing all
those things that would have been evenly divided between the two of us.
I am realizing that my busy schedule that I was able to maintain, was
partly possible because my wife was around to take on many of the tasks
I took for granted. Even the small things add up too. I thought we would
be able to periodically each have leisure time allowing for personal
projects of various sorts. Living as a duo it is possible to have one
person work, while the other does other things, and vice versa,
switching as desired. I am also stuck in a lawsuit involving an attempt
to make my drive way a public trail, which is somewhat high profile and
well known throughout Anchorage and surrounding areas. This is costly
and takes away from my goals to build, and to expand my business, and
otherwise reach my final goals. Finally, there are neighbors who are
simply interfering with my life. I’m living an unexpected tale of
ostracism and stigma, for buying land that was already the subject of
longstanding dispute.</p>
<p>Despite these issues, I’ve found a way to take the situation and spin
it to my advantage in a number of ways. When I was young I was tested
for my aptitudes and found that one occupation that was fitting was
“lawyer,” which makes sense because I’ve always been argumentative, even
since I was a small child. So this was my chance, to take on a case of
my own, as a self-represented attorney, against notable figures in
Alaska. How often does such an opportunity take place? Similarly, while
I was divorce, I came to understand living alone as well. My initial
dream to live in Alaska was made without having a significant other, and
so the solitude did not at all reduce the experience; rather, it assumed
it. Much is different than I expected, but much is the same, if I only
put myself in the position of when I first dreamed this dream, and after
everything, I have so much more to learn and to experience, and I have a
large and beautiful property in Anchorage, that is scenic enough for
locals to want to make it a park of sorts.</p>
<p>You will enjoy this book, if you are interested in frugal living, and
in trying to attain a level of leisure that makes it possible to live an
alternative lifestyle, like living in a tiny house, traveling abroad, or
living off grid in nature. There is much that is not standard in my
experiences to share, and many pitfalls that the reader would be good to
avoid!</p>
<p>You will like this book if you are outdoorsy, and have an interest in
living in a remote location, far from urban and suburban lifestyles.
Although, again, you might be conflicted about how far you live away
from normal life, which brings with it many conveniences that are hard
to do without. The gym, social contact, restaurants, movie theaters,
etc… If you have an idea that you would like to live in a remote
location without these things, you might find some gotchas in this book
worth preparing for.</p>
<p>Do you want to live in a tiny home or an RV? Do you want to develop
property, and build a home on a vacant parcel? I’ve learned quite a bit
about these experiences, and have faced obstacles that you could do well
to avoid.</p>
<p>Did you come from a different background, and want to try out living
in the country? Do you work in a field, or would you like to work in a
field, that permits a remote lifestyle?</p>
<p>If you are interested in living free of debt, in a state of early
retirement, or partial retirement, out in nature, but want to continue
to enjoy some luxuries, and maintain a rewarding career, then you may
find much of interest in this book. That’s my lifestyle, and that was my
goal. It is possible. My current life is complex, and I faced and am
facing many challenges, but much of what I’m now navigating could be
considerably simplified with better planning, and more experience. I was
out for an adventure, and I had very little experience for some of the
things I was attempting. But now I know much better. I think these
experiences could easily help someone who might want to venture to do
the same kinds of things, pursuing the same kinds of dreams.</p>
<p>This book covers living off grid, differences between RVs and Tiny
houses, pitfalls that can be avoided in buying vacant land, how to
handle land related legal issues, issues with small town gossip and
ostracism, alternative lifestyles in environments not expecting it,
experiences living in a habitat teeming with wildlife, near national and
state parks, and the lifestyle of working in the field of technology,
working remotely, at distant locations far from cities requiring the
work.</p>
<p>It’s about modern homesteading.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in a lifestyle that mixes old and new, and want
to have more time to yourself, to enjoy your interests, I invite you to
read more about what I’ve experienced!</p>
<p>The goal of this book is to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recount the adventures of the author, and</li>
<li>Provide useful tools, pitfalls, gotchas, captured along the way,
about:
<ul>

<h2 id="chapter-1.-our-end-goal">Chapter 1. Our End Goal</h2>
<p><strong><em>My Early Interest in Living in Nature</em></strong></p>
<p>When I was a kid, I usually didn’t want toys for birthday
presents—instead, I wanted possessions that would carry value, that I
could keep for a long time. Possessions that wouldn’t break, that had
durable utility. They had to be things I really wanted, could use for a
long time, and wouldn’t diminish in value. This was an oddity since most
of my friends did not have the same concern about gaining possessions of
durable value, and instead prefered gifts that were for immediate play,
and would be discarded, or grown out of, quite quickly.</p>
<p>I didn’t find value in the toys and possessions that many kids wanted
and received. I asked for weird things. We had a dollar value maximum of
what we could ask for. In my early childhood, we did not receive much,
but after my family business became more profitable, we were able to ask
for much more. Some years I would ask for a video game system, a
television, stereo system or other. Each possession I asked for lasted
for a very long period of use, in comparison with many toys I saw other
friends receive.</p>
<p>One year, I asked for mostly camping equipment. Some of that
equipment I have in my possession to the present day, 25 or more years
later. I have a cookstove, knife, tarp, rope, and other equipment I
received when I was around 15 years old.</p>
<p>I grew up in a semi-rural area of Maryland, that some might
characterize as the outer suburbs, while others might have considered it
the countryside. I lived in a small ranch style brick home, with an old
fashioned well in front (a facade really, although it did have an
electric pump that drew fresh water into our house). Our house is in a
neighborhood with rolling hills, homes with different constructions,
gardens, and most people had at least 1 acre. We had nearly two, and it
included raspberry bushes, extensive honeysuckle vines/bushes that way
laid and played in in the summer, diverse large trees, and true forest.
We had streams nearby and extensive vacant land to play in, and I have
fond memories of playing alone or with friends in these woods, either
exploring or fishing. We used to look for crayfish under rocks, and
would routinely play in the water. Other times we were playing sports
like baseball and basketball outside, and many of us could have been
characterized as “free range” children with mostly outdoor lifestyles. I
had a very beautiful childhood in the country.</p>
<p>From a young age my father helped to create an interest in fishing
and survival. While he hunted, and my other uncles did as well, my
mother did not approve of guns in the home, so any firearms he possessed
were locked away in a safe, or were stored at his business, where we
couldn’t find a way to get to them (and I recall my brother and his
friends did, without any incident, but they did find them nevertheless).
So I did not hunt, but we enjoyed camping as a family, and hiking, and
fishing.</p>
<p>In my early teens, my parents decided to take us on a different kind
of vacation. Previously we would visit the Chesapeake bay and the
Marshes and Beaches near Ocean City, MD, but one year my parents decided
to take us on a road trip instead. We had a brand new van with several
rows of seats to make sure we were all comfortable. While the trip
turned out to be largely miserable, from what I recall, because of the
many decisions my parents had to make along the way, with tired, bored,
or hungry children, it was still the trip that had the greatest
impression on me.</p>
<p>I saw the rocky mountains for the first time. The great plains. The
Mississippi and Missouri rivers. We went to many different National
Parks. The whole experience gave me ideas of what I could potentially
do, when I was old enough to venture off on my own. While I thought the
East Coast around Maryland was quite beautiful, nearly everything stood
out as different, and new, and interesting on this trip. Rocky mountain
streams, and snowy mountains in the summertime. Rocky peaks, showing
different colors and hues at different times of day, didn’t exist in
Maryland. Maryland does not have any lakes. I was finding crystal clear
lakes, that you could see way deep to the bottom, with many kinds of
fish that were rare in Maryland, that was slowly becoming too polluted
to enjoy. These areas were still clean, and to my mind at the time,
purse and pristine, and adventure and exploration worthy. There were so
many hills and mountains, that I would wonder how I could climb.
“Wouldn’t it be amazing to just walk out there, and spend time alone or
with a single friend, on that hill, <em>that</em> mountain?</p>
<p>And there was so much of it.</p>
<p>While on the vacation, I took on the task of tracking and planning
our journey via the standard national highway roadmap, National Atlas,
that gave detail for each and every state, and was probably about 24”
long by 18 inches wide. I used a device my father gave to me that my
grandfather gave to him, for tracing roadways to estimate trip length.
Since roads are not straight, one cannot relate the path to the straight
key on the map exactly. This tool would allow you to measure the length
with a wheel that you could roll along the path, and relate to the key,
to get a more precise driving time. I still have this device to this
day, although certainly I would rely on GPS to autocalculate exactly
instead.</p>
<p>However, this made me interested in maps, and in school cartography,
and projections. This simple interest in plotting courses and
calculating distances, and tracking progress, made me very much
interested in other topics of geography, that later included estimating
time and location from the solar elevation, among other things.</p>
<p>While on the trip, my parents also allowed us to indulge in buying
knickknacks, that in retrospect, must have added up to a small fortune.
I collected hat pins for every state we visited (I no longer have
these). I also purchased a book on national parks, which gave a
description of each and every park in the nation, along with photographs
and maps.</p>
<p>This single book is what drew my attention to Alaska. I went to
Yellowstone National Park, which was amazing. but the book showed parks
much further north. More pristine. Larger—more wild. Suddenly I had a
strong desire to go to Alaska.</p>
<p>When I returned from my adventure, I shared my experiences with a
really close friend at the time, my first best friend, Chris Soulé. He
was my first true friend. We spent most of our childhoods doing anything
and everything together, and both loved the outdoors and fishing. I
remember sharing my intense interest in Alaska with him, and he too
ended up wanting to go with me on a trip.</p>
<p>Later we ended up parting ways, and sadly he passed away in early
adulthood, but I will always remember that my interest in going to
Alaska, and my interest in nature itself, is bound up with our
experiences in our little part of the earth, which had plenty of
adventure for us, around the streams and forest in Maryland.</p>
<p>While I wasn’t able to go on a road trip with Chris, I did go on
numerous roadtrips with my good friend Jacob and my wife Kim, crossing
the country from the east to west coasts, no less than 6 times
total.</p>
<p>Later in my teens, I encountered two books and a video that
increased, or at least sustained, my ongoing interest in going to
Alaska. A video created by Richard Proeneke sharing his experience
homesteading what would later become Lake Clark national park had a
powerful draw. He seemed like someone I wanted to emulate. It is rare
that I ever see someone doing something I would like to nearly duplicate
without alteration. Almost always there is something I see that I would
change; I need to put my own creativity into it, do something a little
different. But nearly everything Richard Proeneke does in his journey on
his homestead is so fascinating to me, I felt like I wanted to attempt
everything he did myself, even if just to have a complete learning
experience. He built a cabin that still stands today in that, park,
using mostly hand tools and materials found on site. I encountered this
video again in my twenties, and again in my thirties, and each time I
see it, I have renewed interest, even as I live in Alaska today.</p>
<p>While still in HighSchool I read the book “Into the Wild” that others
are also familiar with, because the book is popular in High School
reading lists, and also because there was a movie made telling the same
story. This book recounts the travel experiences of Christopher
McCandless, who made his final destination Alaska, which was also the
place of his apparently accidental death. In many ways I see myself of
similar spirit to Christopher McCandless, although in methodology and
preparation I see myself as being quite different. nevertheless, his
story was one that inspired me to really want to visit myself, and
continue in my explorations.</p>
<p>A work of fiction that also stuck in my mind, and made me imagine my
own demise would be wintery, was “To Build a Fire”, by Jack London, a
short fictional story about a man’s failed attempt to build a fire to
save himself from harsh winter conditions. While the plot takes place in
Yukon Territory, it is one reminiscent of Alaska, and this too served to
increase my interest in making a trip.</p>
<p>Not long after my ex-wife and I started our relationship, I pitched
the idea about going or moving to Alaska. She didn’t seem to think much
of the idea early on, and for the most part, this suggestion went
forgotten. But later on in our relationship, it was raised again, and
suddenly, she was interested in going. In 2009 we went on a road trip of
our own (not our first), and drove all of the way to Alaska. That trip
was a fascinating story in itself, bu that is for another time. For now
it is enough to mention, that I was first interested in moving to Alaska
due to a true passion for the outdoors, a vision for adventure in remote
wilderness, and love for fishing and survivalism. Later on my wife and
I, after making trips of our own, became very fond of the nature outside
the D.C. area and it became a respite from normal work life. A place to
escape from noise, and traffic and work, and we thought moving to Alaska
would provide much of what we wanted to be able to do this. And it did.
We lived there for almost a year, as intended from the outset, and
returned back (although I returned to DC reluctantly).</p>
<p>After another decade of working and consulting, in an attempt to save
enough money to escape work, we finally amassed enough funds to make
another permanent move back to Alaska, to make it our permanent home
base. After time living in other locations, like Miami, Florida, and
Charlotte, North Carolina, we realized we really didn’t need to live
near family as much as we thought we did. So we decided to move back to
the place we enjoyed living the most, and that was Anchorage Alaska.</p>
<p><strong><em>Goals of Early Retirement</em></strong></p>
<p>We moved to Alaska with dreams of early retirement. Not retirement in
the traditional sense—I did not expect to apply for social security, or
otherwise live a life completely in leisure. That was not my goal, and
wasn’t my goal when I first began planning and preparing for it.
Instead, I would complete my plans for becoming a writer, of enjoying my
hard won savings, amassed for the specific purpose of gaining that
freedom necessary to write my book on Moral Philosophy, that I had
started working on, in various forms, over two decades ago.</p>
<p>When I first started my journey I was married. My wife of 19 years,
and I, were going to buy land, build a small house on it, and live the
remainder of our lives debt-free. We would work any jobs that we wanted,
for as long as necessary, and periodically, not continuously. Using this
approach we would be free and would have the energy to do whatever we
wanted with our time, without committing too much of our time and energy
to other people. I wanted to explore, work on art, and of course
continue my studies and my writings.</p>
<p>This is a dream that many people have, although they usually plan it
for later in life. Either way, few have the opportunity and discipline
to make it happen, and we were both very aware that we were lucky to be
able to begin such a lifestyle, albeit it took a tremendous amount of
work and sacrifice to get into the position to do it. We lived far
beneath our means in order to make this life possible and were intent on
living a life of comfort after many years of forgoing various
comforts.</p>
<p>We decided to have no children, and that each of us would work, for
the most part, to increase our savings, to ensure we always had extra
funds for financial security, whatever the situation we envisioned we
would encounter. We would live a humble lifestyle by having few
possessions, making mostly frugal purchases, and by living in a home
with a small square footage. We shared a single vehicle for many years,
and I commuted for a while on bicycle. We would spend money on periodic
vacations, and on frequent dining at restaurants, but other than this,
we did not spend much on anything. Neither of use spent much money at
all on clothes, and usually found ways to make it nearly free.</p>
<p>We lived well, but certainly sacrificed many comforts that made our
life seem a little outside the norm. But we knew this living arrangement
would allow us to save enough funds to make an early semi-retired
lifestyle more than possible. It was probable. And after many years
working hard, and making sacrifices to save, we finally had enough to
relocate to Alaska permanently. Where it would be quiet, we would have
few tax liabilities, and we would still have access to all that we enjoy
in life, especially nature.</p>
<p>We lived this lifestyle for over 15 years continuously. I worked
extra hours and incredibly hard on my career, and for years worked two
jobs to try to bring the plans to fruition.</p>
<p>By 2016 it was clear that we were ready to make it possible, and
departed from Maryland to Alaska, driving for 3 months in newly
purchased Fifth-wheel RV, and Ford F-250 pickup truck, to our final
destination in Anchorage, Alaska.</p>

<p><em>(Photo of my ex-wife, happy and enjoying herself, just after

<p>Things would not turn out how either of us expected, however.</p>
<p>Fast forward to May, 2019 and, suddenly, I was divorced. Half my
savings was gone. Job security was diminished. I was in legal and
financial trouble. I was in social trouble dealing with neighbors and
residents of Anchorage as well. Much was going well, since my business
was highly successful until that time, but there were many issues that
prevented full enjoyment of that, and by 2020 things were not nearly as
secure. Whatever positive existed, however, 2019 was easily the worst
year of my life.</p>
<p>Much was on the verge of going wrong by 2019, but there was one key
decision that precipitated everything else: I chose to buy a large plot
of land in the wrong location, around the wrong people, with the wrong
history.</p>
<p>I made a snap decision, to buy something much larger than I needed or
wanted, simply because of how spectacular the views were, and the
properties proximity to Anchorage. Married with two incomes and a shared
savings, this was no problem at all; but divorced with half the
resources, it became a serious problem.</p>

<p><em>(View of the McHugh Peak, in Chugach State Park, just opposite

<p>In so many ways it appeared to be the best possible property I could
obtain! Perhaps it still is! But nevertheless, it was contrary to the
aims in my life. And the purchased catalyzed many changes, both expected
and unexpected, that were for the worse. One story stands out among
others as a reason for writing the book I’m now planning to complete. It
was more than a motivation to write the book. The event made the book,
or at least a length account of my experience, entirely necessary to
complete!</p>
<p><strong><em>Our Long-term Vision</em></strong></p>
<p>Up to the just before moving to Alaska, I had the following plan. I
would buy a decently sized chunk of land, eventually, with the intention
to build a very large building with a modular living space. For a long
time, I wanted to live in a building that made it possible to play
basketball, climb ropes, and move parts of the living space around, and
change things, such that the entire environment was not a static home,
in the typical sense. I imagined it might be between 10,000 and say,
25,000 square feet, and 40-50 feet in the center. It would be a large
warehouse like structure, with windows as desired added later, and
perhaps an earthen encasement, with grass atop, to make it blend in with
the land, and utilize natural insulation. Outside this house would be a
runway that would allow me to operate my plane anytime I wanted, in
order to travel to client destinations, making it possible for me to
eliminate the need for airfare with major Airlines, and to travel
entirely on my own. This way, I could own my own business, working in
technology, and actually fly myself to all my client destinations,
potentially free of cost, or with all expenses covered, in the same way
that they would be covered, flying on a normal plane. But in this case,
it would be without the waits in line, and without the flight hours
going to the pilot of the jet. Instead, I would get all flight hours,
all funds would go towards paying off my own plane, and I would be able
to travel at my own leisure, and pace, and according to my own
plans.</p>
<p>The plane would occupy my same living space, since I would have a
hangar entrance, and when I arrived back home from work, or any other
excursion, I imagined myself landing, entering the hangar, and parking
the plane near my kitchen or bedroom.</p>
<p>About 10 years prior, I was lucky enough to be nudged into flight by
my Father, who went into fight training himself, although he ultimately
discontinued it. Hoping he would be able to share old already paid-for
flight hours with me, he took me to the airport to inquire about a
discovery flight and taking first lessons. While his flight hours long
expired, because of a school closing, I was already on board to try it
out for myself. I was very unnatural and did not really feel incredibly
enthusiastic about flight, the way I did about many other things. But
after some training, I became increasingly good at it, until finally I
was able to fly solo on my own, and pass the written exam requited to
get a Private Pilot’s license. At this moment, that’s where I left off.
I ended up taking new jobs, and moving around, and changing flight
instructors, making it difficult to complete my studies and take my
exam. Nevertheless, I’m planning to resume my classes and eventually
complete this goal of mine, to have a place with my own plane and
landing strip. I even planned to build my own plane, which is not so
expensive as it might sound, although it takes quite a large number of
hours and dedication, to complete the build (Roughly 750-1000 hours, at
less than 30,000 USD currently), for Piper Super Cub, which happens to
be a favorite among bush pilots.</p>
<p>On my new piece of land, affordably acquired, with large home, of the
cheapest warehouse-like construction, and inexpensive plane, I thought I
could work in a semi-retired state, on and off again, on my own
property, full of possibilities and ways to play. All of this I hoped to
attain at a modest age, hopefully in my thirties.</p>
<p>This was the main vision I had, living in Alaska, with my best-friend
and wife, Kim, who I was happily married to for many years, since we
first met while still in High School in 1998 (although we crossed paths
earlier in the same middle school). This was the end state, that was
basically the final picture in which I would finally live settled. We
travelled around for many years, and were in a state of flux, and with
this transition, I hoped, we would live a really interesting lifestyle,
mostly free of any major costs, and even a need to work all that hard. I
hoped we would have much to do, and plenty of opportunity for adventure
and travel.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-2.-frugal-living-and-semi-retirement">Chapter 2. Frugal
living and semi-retirement</h2>
<p>As the time got closer to make the real transition, we realized it
might not be reasonable, given our funds, to buy everything we wanted at
the outset. We had to phase our way into it. So in keeping with our
frugal lifestyle, which I will discuss further later, we wanted to live
out the tiny house dream. We were used to living in small studio
apartments, and thought that we could procure a small piece of land, and
pay everything off. We had a good savings since I was successful in the
technology, working as a software architect at Adobe Systems and other
companies, and my wife was successful in her career working in
education, with respect from a huge number of people that she worked
with in and around our hometown, and elsewhere, including Alaska already
too. While we had a lot saved, we were not prepared to risk it all, and
thought it would make sense, to start modestly, and get ourselves in a
situation that could be permanently retirable as well, making it
possible to remain in that state even if we never transitioned to follow
through with the ultimate goal, which felt lofty in a number of ways.
The primary plan was the one I told everyone, and the one my friends and
I enjoyed fantasizing about, but it didn’t feel entirely reasonable or
immediately realizable at the time, although ultimately possible.</p>
<p>This goal of living in a tiny house, or RV, on a piece of land, was
very much in keeping with our views on simplicity and living mostly care
free about expenses. We already enjoyed this lifestyle, and the luxuries
it made possible as well. We frequently traveled, and stayed in nice
hotels, and ate out at restaurants at least 3-4 nights a week, and were
still able to save substantial amounts of money, because of this
lifestyle. For that reason, we were already bought into the idea of
living frugally, and trying to cut out all costs. Since we lived in
apartments, and had a condo rented out to property management, that we
were wanting to finally rid of, and felt stuck in many ways, not having
a really good property that we wanted to settle in, we were ready to
have a place of our own, that was totally ours, paid in full.
Interestingly, this was also becoming trendy at the time, as many
television shows attest, and there wasn’t much to discourage us from
thinking it was realistic or a good way of living.</p>
<p><a name="planning-our-trip"></a></p>
<h2 id="chapter-3.-planning-our-trip">Chapter 3. Planning Our Trip</h2>
<p>At the time we were living in McLean, Virginia, near my workplace,
and briefly, during a transitional period, at my family’s home, where I
grew up, in Olney/Silver Spring, Maryland. We had a lot to do, without
any truck, or RV, or tiny house, to get from Maryland, up to Alaska.
Although, we did actually make the transition once before, with a fully
packed subaru forester SUV.</p>
<p>One of the more stressful parts about making a transition to RV
living, or tiny house living, in a completely new location, is that it
may entail a transition from one job to another. Knowing a couple that
made a similar transition, without an RV or Tiny House or RV, we were
well aware that it can cause stress, particularly if jobs have not been
arranged for in advance. It is an extremely fortunate situation, if the
job allows for remote work, enabling a transition without any great
reliance on savings.</p>
<p>Our strategy, like the time we moved to Alaska before, was to live
off of savings for a period of time, or three months in our case, as it
would turn out, before getting new jobs. We were not totally certain
what those new jobs would be, although I had the intention of going into
business for myself, to continue my occupation as a technology leader,
but working for my own company instead of as an employee. My wife was
previously employed at a very good company, so anticipated that she may
have the opportuntity to work in that company again.</p>
<p>So it might seem as though there would be no hardship along the way,
since we had ample savings, had experience with a transition, and each
expected to have jobs once in Alaska, but it still was quite difficult
for a number of reasons.</p>
<p>First we knew we wanted to be in Anchorage, but where exactly? We
weren’t sure. Our first experience in Anchorage was similar. We arrived
having no idea where we would live, and were quite stressed and
disoriented until we first located our apartment, which we obtained on
month-to-month terms.</p>
<p><a name="road-tripping-with-your-house"></a></p>
<h2 id="chapter-4.-road-tripping-with-your-house">Chapter 4. Road
Tripping With Your House</h2>
<p>A daunting thought when we set out on our journey was how we were
going to tow such a long and large vehicle for the first time, all of
the way across the country. Our plan was to drive no less than 6,000
miles, from Washington D.C. all of the way to Anchorage, Alaska.</p>
<p>We planned our trip so we would not take a direct route. We drove to
Alaska once before, a bit more directly, and took a roughly similar trip
through Canada, in a large sprinter van. We were not unfamiliar with
Road Trips, and this trip would be roughly my 9th time across the
country by car, coast to coast or nearly so on some trips.</p>
<p>This time we planned on taking four months off, with plans to spend
time in areas we might find interesting all across the country. We
planned to drive south to the Gulf coast of Florida first, then across
the country to see the Southwest, a location I still had not been, and
then up to the North along the Rocky Mountains, up through British
Columbia, Canada, through the Yukon Territories, and over through Alaska
in a more northern portion, through some beautiful and spectacular areas
around Wrangell St. Elias National park, before finally making our way
down into Anchorage.</p>
<p>I had experience driving a medium sized box truck doing deliveries in
my family business, which was challenging at times. I knew the
difficulties of backing up, getting around in smaller areas, and having
to watch for trees and branches that could clip the top of the vehicle
where you cannot see. You have to be far more aware of the dimensions of
the vehicle and be watchful for all sorts of unexpected scenarios.</p>
<p>This was going to be the very first time, for the both of us, driving
a vehicle with a trailer attached. I was so unfamiliar with the process
I had no idea what truck to buy, how to size the RV to the truck, or
which RV options existed. Neither of use spent any time in an RV.
Neither of us drove a commercial vehicle, and in many ways, larger RVs
are like big trucks you see professional drivers, who are licensed,
doing their jobs with. It is an occupation to drive such vehicles.</p>
<p>It was exciting, but I have to admit, I did have some worries about
how hard it might be. Especially on the basis of what I heard about
mountain driving, with the concern about going down steep grades for
long periods of time, and the safety involved with controlling speed,
getting the right towing and braking system, and dangers of heavy
gusting winds. There are plenty of stories online about deadly
situations with RVs, and in some ways, I wondered to myself how anyone
else managed to do it without creating too much risk.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we decided to take the plunge and invest in a brand new
truck and RV.</p>
<h3 id="buying-the-truck-and-rv">Buying the Truck and RV</h3>
<p>Soon after my wife and I decided that we definitely wanted to
relocate to Alaska, we started to consider options. We were quick to
determine that we wanted an RV of some type, because they seemed more
adaptable and versatile, and potentially we could use it for vacation if
we ever transitioned into a new home instead. But we had no idea what
kind of RV we would get, and there is a large variety.</p>
<p>Despite this, we did have the idea that our most likely option would
be a truck and trailer combination, because then we would be able to
leave our trailer behind and drive the truck independently. If we wanted
to get rid of the truck, we could get rid of it. I remembered seeing old
and crusty RVs and Motorhomes that seemed to depend entirely on having
an engine to keep their value. Instead, I wanted to have the RV
indefinitely, and be able to switch out vehicles.</p>
<p>During our search, we looked at half million dollar mobile homes,
small and inexpensive travel trailers, fifth-wheel trailers, and a range
of other conversion vehicles (van RVs and so on). Converted vehicles and
vans seemed to be far too much for the value, so we passed on those
quickly. Some seemed to be little more than inexpensive pickup trucks
and van cabs, with boxes attached, at double the price. They were
attractive in their own ways, but really we didn’t like those so much.
We did, however, really like the motor homes. I would like to have a
motor home, if possible, in the future, but at the time spending
hundreds of thousands of dollars with plans to buy land didn’t seem
reasonable.</p>
<p>We then started to focus more on detached trailers. Ones that hook on
the back of the truck by standard trailer ball hitches, which are called
travel trailers, and also fifth-wheel trailers, which are taller and
larger, going over the back of the truck and into a trailer hitch, much
like a smaller version of a tractor trailer.</p>
<p>Long story short, we went with the fifth wheel trailer. The biggest
reason was that they were the only option for connecting to the back of
a truck that seemed to approach the quality and luxury of the motorhome.
We needed somethings stable for our long trip, and we didn’t want it
swinging in the wind, and the risks of jacknifing into oncoming traffic,
or otherwise losing the trailer somehow. From all the research I did, I
found that fifth wheel trailers are far better for towing and taking
along the road.</p>
<p>This is an important consideration, even if you don’t plan to own an
RV. If you are thinking of building or buying a tiny house, that will be
towed behind a vehicle, you will need to think carefully about what kind
of vehicle you will use to tow it, and whether or not you will use a
fifth-wheel hitch or goose-neck hitch (both are really stable like with
large commercial transport trucks), or the ball hitch. There are also
very great differences in how much you can tow for your vehicle, and you
will need to carefully compute what is safe for your vehicle. We did
this carefully and chose it on the basis of what our Ford F-250 truck
could support in the bed of the trailer, and how much it can tow.
Pressure from a fifth-wheel trailer is downward into the bed of the
truck, versus with a travel trailer, where the extra weight is all of
the way on the far back of the truck.</p>
<p>We ended up getting a very successful combination.</p>
<p><a name="vegan-in-alaska-and-on-the-road"></a></p>
<h2 id="chapter-5.-vegan-in-alaska-and-on-the-road">Chapter 5. Vegan in
Alaska and On the Road</h2>
<p><br /><img class="ui huge center image transition visible"   src="foraging-edible-young-fiddlehead-fern.jpg" /><br /></p>
<p><strong>Young, unfurled and edible fiddlehead fern. From near one of
my seasonal streams.</strong></p>
<p>I’ve been vegetarian since Thanksgiving 2000, and vegan since January
2001. So it’s been nearly 20 years and many have asked me “How can you
be Vegan in Alaska?” Of course, places in the far north approaching the
Arctic do not bring to mind agriculture and fields of varieties of
vegetables. Instead, we think of fishing for salmon, hunting, trapping,
cold, ice, darkness, and maybe even whale or seal hunting expeditions.
After hearing so many people ask it, and recalling my original reasons
for wanting to visit (to see the outdoors, and experience some
survivalism), I can’t fault anyone for wondering. But the truth is there
is so much to do besides these activities, and contrary to all
expectations, Alaska does produce large quantities of produce, although
mostly the hearty fall and winter crops, which can grow to massive sizes
because of prolonged daylight in the summer time. There are also large
varieties of berries and other products which are more commonly found
here than elsewhere and some native plant species which can be
eaten.</p>
<p>Part of my interest in my land is to forage for food, although since
I’ve been preoccupied with so many other activities, I haven’t been able
to fully take advantage of this yet. For many plants there is a very
short window for collection too, so foraging is not exactly something
that can be done most of the year either, except for one plant:
rosehips. I walk around my property snacking on the infinite number of
rosehips around. They taste like small tart apples. These are commonly
dried and used for tea, and can be found in stores across the United
States. But I have never seen them fresh until I bought this property
and they are everywhere. I hear they’re a good source of vitamin C.
While I’m out I eat far more than I should and could easily collect
gallons of them for many months of the year. Even after first snow, I’ve
seen them popping out through, looking just fine and ready to taste.</p>
<p>You can also eat small ferns, and other plants while they are still
very young, and tender, before they change character and become largely
inedible. In this respect they remind me of bamboo shoots, which I used
to see in Maryland, sprouting up through the soil, ready to be eaten for
a very short time, much like white asparagus, and asparagus in general,
before it becomes a tiny tree. My family grew asparagus in our garden
when I was a kid, and I’m happy to have the chance to try to find
anything and everything I can eat off my lot, at whatever stage of
development the plant allows for it. I’ve even been chomping on
dandelions, which are quite good, even though most think of them as
worthless weeds. They are not native to Alaska, but nevertheless are
plentiful and easily passed up, without good reason, for greens that
must be purchased at the grocery store instead (not that one would want
to stop shopping at the grocery store).</p>
<p><br /><img class="ui huge center image transition visible"   src="dandelions-to-munch.jpg" /><br /></p>
<p><br /><img class="ui huge center image transition visible"   src="dandelions-to-munch-2.jpg" /><br /></p>
<p><strong>Everyone’s favorite weed: the Dandelion. Plentiful and yummy.
And somewhat odd to eat.</strong></p>
<p>One cannot be a Vegan in Alaska without depending on an outside
source of nutrition, however. I would argue that one cannot be a happy
Alaskan without eating food that comes from someplace else though, and
the grocery system here is surprisingly high quality. I think grocery
stores are significantly better than most I’ve grown up with and have
had access to almost anyplace I’ve lived. Variety is good, prices are
good, and quality is pretty high almost all year round. Produce
especially. But it depends on where you live.</p>
<p>In Anchorage, and the vicinity, there are too many grocery stores of
high quality to count. Out in the Alaskan villages, which are found
scattered across the state, much fewer options exist and prices are
extremely high. I once advertised for a company here in Alaska, when I
first moved here in 2009, called “Alaska Bush Shoppers.” At that time, I
recall that bush shopping through Sams Club and this company, and
others, was more common seemingly than it is today, although I have not
stayed apprised in changes. I think it is just easier to order online
most likely. But at that time, people have the postal service air
deliver and even air drop food, which came from a catalog that did not
appear to be anything nearly as healthy as what existed in the grocery
stores. People were willing to pay 5 dollars for a snickers bar, or some
value near that amount, simply to have that taste they craved from not
having access to the normal grocery store.</p>
<p>Kim also had a job for a time in the early childhood education system
(head start), and she would visit these tiny villages. She said the
grocery stores were really expensive–incredibly so, and did not have a
very large variety of options. This makes sense, because in many of
these locations, there was very little there but an airstrip, some small
number of stores, and a school house, which took on a more central role
as a place to gather than elsewhere. She would even sleep in the
schoolhouse, since there were no other accommodations. People who live
in these areas take sustainable living seriously and get much of their
diet from elsewhere, from hunting, fishing, or a lifestyle that is more
in keeping with what you would expect from indigenous peoples of the
area.</p>
<p>While at one point I was fascinated by the idea of living a
survivalist lifestyle, or a life off the land, I would only want to
attempt that in a climate that could completely support it with the
requisite legumes, seeds, nuts, and any other food that I could largely
survive on but is adequate variety to keep me from getting bored. But
that is a daunting task, to be a farmer of so many different types of
foods, wherever you happen to live. And I really prefer to have my home
base in Alaska. That means I need to be able to get along with what
exists in the store, and in that way, I’m not different from anyone else
living in any city across the United States and Canada, and as I was
saying, in many ways I’m better off for having land I could farm,
forage, and grocery stores of high quality; even though that might come
as a surprise to some readers that that would be the case. I can’t claim
these stores would impress everyone from everywhere, but compared to
Maryland, Virginia and Miami Beach, these stores really are pretty good.
Produce can be better quality and cheaper. Some foods like Chips,
processed vegan foods, and Cereals seem far more expensive though,
presumably because of shipping costs associated with high volume boxes
at low weight.</p>
<p>10 years ago, being vegan here was more difficult in the sense that
restaurants did not really serve vegan options, that were not the same
options everyone else at that happened to be vegan (bread sticks, french
fries, etc…), although I can remember I could get the basic veggie
sandwich at Subway, soy drinks at Starbucks, and veggie burritos at
Qdoba. Today, however, there is a much greater variety of vegetarian and
vegan options, and some places make special efforts to cater to these
groups. I have innumerable options and almost everyone has the more
current veggie burger options, the newer vegetarian meats (“Impossible”
and “Beyond Meat” burgers). One change was that every coffee place I
visit seems to have any variant of veggie milk you could want: Coconut
milk, almond milk, etc., in addition to the standard soy option. There
is no difficulty whatsoever being Vegan here, and when I return back to
Maryland to visit family, I feel as though I have the same or even fewer
options.</p>
<p>Sit-in restaurants also have many more options than before, and in
Anchorage I can find plenty of places to eat, such that I don’t get
bored, or run out of new and different options. Even when leaving the
area, there seem to be plenty of options. I believe this is largely due
to the impact of the tourism industry, as Veganism has become so
widespread that many people visiting Alaska, presumably, put pressure to
offer these options to ensure that they are comfortable. Hospitality is
good. I always felt like Alaska had superior waiters and hostesses, in
comparison with almost every other place I visited. More recently I’ve
had some difficulties, but that was only after living in the state for a
very long time as a resident. Prior to that I only noticed that staff
was really high quality at almost every restaurant I would go to.</p>
<p>More recently, I even discovered there is a Vegan Society of Alaska
here, near Palmer, AK, close to where I was living in my RV in the
winter, and near where I’m now living. I joined and there is a fairly
large membership, with the last meeting hosting around 20-30 for a vegan
potluck. I was invited by someone I ran into at a grocery store,
browsing for veggie products that were on sale. I felt a little
ridiculous that I did not seek out such a group sooner, but it is clear
that groups of people do exist in and around Anchorage who characterize
themselves as vegetarian or vegan.</p>
<p>People seem accepting of veganism too. A decade ago, I can remember
debating about it, and maybe I could find people here who are still not
exposed sufficiently to understand that it is a viable way of life.
Nevertheless, I can tell there have been changes. I still don’t feel
compelled to tell anyone about my lifestyle choice, but I also feel that
it would be less of a cause for ostracism or stigma than before. An
upcoming younger generation seems to be much more tolerant of differing
lifestyles, at least from what I can tell, not being incredibly steeped
in the community, for a number of reasons relating to business, my
lawsuit, and my divorce, which considerably changed how I approached
relationships with others.</p>
<p>“Do you fish?” and “Do you hunt?” are common questions that come up.
My answers usually are “I used to fish,” and “My family hunts, but my
mother kept me from getting involved in guns as a kid, so I mostly hike
and enjoy nature.”</p>
<p>I’ve been vegetarian since Thanksgiving 2000, and vegan since January
2001. So it’s been nearly 20 years. I could easily be criticized for not
being more open with my lifestyle, but with my property situation, I
find that people are so nosy and gossipy, I’d prefer to not share every
detail about it so others can converse about how non-Alaskan they think
I am. This has nothing to do with receptiveness to the diet though, and
more to do with social issues faced regarding the property, and the fact
that so many neighbors who are involved in the situation are insistent
on knowing information about me, just because I moved in, including who
I am, what my intentions are being in Alaska, how I will develop my
land, and many other minute details. And all the while, I’m wondering
why I don’t know anything about them at all. As part of my lawsuit, I
was even deposed, which meant I had to answer questions with a lawyer
who was probing me about personal details. With these people, in this
situation, then, I’m very much adverse to giving personal details at
this point. I’m very open, and they take advantage of that. Some have
even scoured my social media profiles to mock me in public about what
they found. So the last thing I want to do is talk to people about my
choice of lifestyle, and I certainly don’t spend my time trying to
proselytize or convert anyone.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there is the ongoing complaint about Vegans that we hear
endlessly that we self-announce. Some may do that, and I may have done
that while I was especially interested, when I first started. But the
reality is, people are perceptive when they notice differences. At
dinner, they’ll ask. When they ask, it becomes a longish conversation.
It’s one I’ve had so many times at this point, I usually take a pass,
even when asked in a dinner scenario, or give a polite response and
indicate it might be better to share more at another time.</p>
<p>In summary, however, I have to say, it’s been really easy these days
to be vegan here and on the road. I also think it is highly likely that
writing about this topic will soon become unnecessary. Maybe ten years
from now, it will be so mundane and mainstream, that it will be a truism
that people can live in these areas easily, in a tiny house environment,
growing and even foraging on property, with supplements coming from
grocery stores, and plenty of other options to choose from.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-6.-rvs-and-tiny-houses-in-limbo">Chapter 6. RVs and Tiny
Houses in Limbo</h2>
<p>Before leaving home in the D.C. area for Alaska, I had to decide how
I thought my transition to tiny house living might play out. Was I going
to drive all the way to Alaska, and buy a home there? Was I going to
drive out of state and buy an RV along the way? Or was I going to buy a
piece of land and then decide what I might want to build or place atop
it?</p>
<p>The most economical and generally useful option I could think of was
to buy an RV. While an RV is not typically thought of as a tiny home,
especially if one has in mind those houses that are on television shows
about custom tiny houses that were certainly built to resemble normal
homes, just with a far more compact design—they really are excellent
examples of nearly complete pre-fabricated homes, that can be quite
livable, depending on the model chosen, the choice of location to park
it, and the living arrangements. Not only are they like pre-built homes,
they are also, like tiny houses, constructed with quite a bit of
planning on economy of space, and maximizing utility with tradeoffs not
only for space savings, but for motility (weight, safety, insurability
(as a vehicle), and so on). After owning one, I think it would be
improbable for someone to build a tiny house with the same level of
consideration as it took to design an RV, and this makes sense, because
the RV industry has been around for quite a long time, and like the
automobile industry, it can be expected they would have considerable
expertise accumulated. The same isn’t quite true with the construction
of modular tiny homes.</p>
<p>However, after much time spent in an RV, I can say that an RV really
is not a complete replacement for a real home. And I see a tiny home as
a true home, if it is not permanently mounted on wheels. This is because
the construction is far more durable, and the walls, insulation, and
materials are much more akin to a normal house if done right.</p>
<p>For my RV, I chose a fifth-wheel trailer. I’m not fond of the name
fifth-wheel, but this type of RV is the kind that hooks into the bed of
a truck, much like a tractor trailer, rather than on the back of the
truck from a ball type hitch. A fifth wheel trailer is much more secure,
much safer and more stable driving down the road, and typically larger
as well.</p>
<p>I was, and continue to be, extremely happy with my selection of truck
and trailer both in terms of the outcome of the driving and
transportation experience, and the quality of the RVs living
environment.</p>
<p>After purchasing it, I couldn’t believe the value of the total
purchase. I had a brand new truck that I could drive independently of
the RV. I had an RV that I could tow across any part of America and
Canada, like a true retiree, and spend time in any city I wanted almost
on a whim. And I also could, park it an effectively live in it, like a
home, if I wanted to. Afterwards it seemed like a very wise decision
that I would not regret, and one I could likely benefit from for many
decades to come (since in my frugal state of mind, I did not imagine
ever parting with the truck, but I imagined I would keep it as long as I
could, until it was like an antique truck itself).</p>
<p>It turned out, that the only area where it was not as great as
investment as I hoped was as a place to permanently dwell. It was
amazing as a recreational vehicle. But it was not as easy as I thought,
or I didn’t make it as easy as I could have made it, to find a permanent
place to keep it where I could reside in it like a normal family home.
And over time, I really wanted to live in it like a normal family home.
I made some choices that probably made it more difficult than it could
have been, and I hope by sharing my stories, some will be able to avoid
the issues that I did. I think they can too, and potentially could
follow nearly the same path I did at first, with little alteration, if
they keep some key items in mind when they make some crucial decisions,
like what land to buy and where, primarily.</p>
<p>What I found, after finally making it to Alaska, was that there was
no easy place to keep it for a long time at a low price. Along the way,
I became quite accustomed to staying extended periods of time at RV
parks across the country, like near national parks near Flagstaff and
Sedona, Arizona, and numerous other locations in the vicinity of livable
cities. Some of these locations were very cost effective, and livable,
but in Alaska I found that options were limited, they seemed less
livable, and were very costly. Monthly rent at an RV park through the
summer and winter could be well over 1,000 a month, and I found myself
living in my own RV, paying for space and energy at rates higher than
much more livable apartment buildings and even single family homes, like
the one I’m now living in.</p>
<p>My wife and I felt like we were in a kind of perpetual limbo trying
to decide where to stay and for how long.</p>
<p>Some days we would park in Walmart or Cabella’s parking lots, which
is quite common and fun for vacation travel, but not so fun when one is
in the city in which one wants to permanently reside. Also, we found
that RV parks did not feel as safe and secure as RV parks in other
places, and Anchorage has quite a high crime rate. Eventually we chose a
nice location in the Palmer/Wasilla area about 45 minutes north of
Anchorage, but then suddenly we found ourselves commuting into town in a
large truck that had as bad gas mileage as it did towing a 10,000 pound
RV behind it, every day, costing us another 400-500 dollars per
month.</p>
<p>The result was that we felt no only in a perpetual state of
indecision (because decisions were often needed), we never quite felt
safe and secure, and were spending more money than we should have been
to live in an RV and not a permanent home. And we were used to living in
very nice environments. We had just relocated from a luxurious apartment
in McLean Virginia, and were now living in a Recreational Vehicle
without complete restroom and shower, or laundry amenities (aside from
what was provided by the park), and slowly we became increasingly aware
of the cheap feel of the RVs construction to cut costs (and to keep
weight down), and things started to break, and simply feel less solid
and comfortable. To give an example, the RV would rock no matter how
well one leveled it or secured it.</p>
<p>RVs and most other mobile vehicles imply work, and incomplete
construction. Some of this is immediately apparent when one starts on an
RV or tiny house adventure, but there is much that is imperceptible that
will become painfully apparent later. Especially if one is living in a
cold environment like Alaska.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-7.-trail-guide-realtors">Chapter 7. Trail Guide
Realtors</h2>
<p>It didn’t take us long to choose the land that we wanted. In
retrospect, I think we could have followed a better purchasing strategy;
but we were in a hurry. We were living in a tiny house in limbo. It was
costly, and it was uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Since the previous time in Anchorage we knew the areas that we would
like to live, and we spent some time re-experiencing our drives along
scenic backroads, and looked in neighborhoods and communities that
overlooked the rest of Anchorage and the water body called Turnagain
Arm, which is the massive inlet into the Pacific Ocean. We had family
visit and brought them into some of these locations, and like anyone
else, they thought they were very beautiful. Behind these properties is
the massive Chugach State Park, which has National Park Quality views, a
vast trail system, plentiful wildlife including bear, lynx, wolves, and
of course, Moose (Alaska’s squirrel as I like to think of them, since
they are so plentiful. After not too long, they come to seem somewhat
mundane, although they still draw plenty of attention from locals
nevertheless, since they are complex, massive animals).</p>
<p>In the upper hillside there were spectacular views, and communities
that had numerous homes positions with incredible vantage points,
offering views that must be hard to tire of. Many of the houses are
beautiful too, and are quite different from one another, and not at all
like the copies and copies of homes found in other locations inside of
Alaska and out of the state. We always found neighborhoods more
interesting and charming, in Maryland and in Charlotte, and elsewhere,
when they had houses that were all considerably different from one
another. One thing we enjoyed doing was exploring, via car, the nicer
neighborhoods that tended to have these qualities, and of course, while
in Alaska we spent our time looking in these locations as well. Even
though we had simple tastes and had no desire or expectations of living
in the really expensive homes in these areas. Our previous living
strategy was to rent nice apartments at a very good rate, in the best
locations we could find, so that we could enjoy these same areas,
without having to pay all that the homeowners would have to.</p>
<p>While driving through one neighborhood that we thought on more than
one occasion would be a nice place to live, Kim found the name of a
realtor that we would ultimately work to buy our new property. He was a
part of a real estate agency called Jack White Real Estate which has a
significant presence in the Anchorage area and nearby locales. She did
some research, as she always did when we were apartment hunting, and
discovered that there were 2.5 acre parcels of land for sale, and that
he was the agent. It was listed at a price of around forty-four
thousand, which was more than we wanted to spend for that amount of
land, but seemed reasonable. Since my family lived on just less than 2
acres, I knew that two and a half would be plenty to place an RV or
build a small home, and have plenty of nature to experience nearby. It
happened that these small parcels were also in the hillside portion of
Anchorage, right up by Chugach State park, meaning there was a state
park of incredible quality just nearby, with few neighbors. We were
interested and so we contacted the real estate agent to take a look.</p>
<p>After contacting our new real estate agent, John Wilson, we were
invited out for a viewing of this smaller parcel, that we were hoping
would provide our respite from living in our tiny RV, that we dragged
here and there, seemingly perpetually in a state of flux.</p>
<p>After driving out into the upper recesses of the mountainous
hillside, along roads and then side roads, and finally roads with signs
like “End of Municipal Maintenance”, dirty and bumpy, we came to our
destination. Houses here made it quite clear that trespassers were not
wanted, and our Realtor impressed upon us the need to makes sure to
create no disturbance, or approach no property without permission.
Specific homes were called out for having onry homeowners. So we parked
in a spot that seemed to be out of the way, and were soon accompanied by
our agent who parked in the same location. Even parking in these
neighborhoods is not a simple matter. When someone parks in these
neighborhoods, there is a reasonable assumption that they will be
trespassing, or doing something otherwise unnecessary, and therefore
unacceptable to many homeowners, particularly if the cars are
unfamiliar.</p>
<p>So we met John, who is a handsome, outdoorsy looking man, around six
feet tall. He was carrying a weapon, which was to be expected, although
at that time, I was not an experienced gun owner. I owned a shotgun
which was purchased for a trip to Prudhoe Bay, on the arctic coast of
Alaska, from and adventure I went on with my Uncle, about ten years
prior; but he was the gun expert, I was not. I never used a handgun, or
had any experience shooting or carrying one. So it was not in the usual
to be spending time with someone openly carrying a large revolver. But
it was necessary in this country since bears are plentiful, and while
there is no expectation of a deadly or risky encounter, it is foolish to
not have some form of protection, over and above the bear spray that is
sold to tourists and other new visitors.</p>
<p>The property was not where we parked. We had to walk up a dirt and
gravel road further up the mountain, and then hike about a quarter mile
into the woods, to find the properties. While we were attracted to one
add, there were a number of properties to choose from, so he took us off
the road to see several. There was no clear path, and no driveway. This
location was completely in the wilderness without any electric or other
utilities, and no way to get to it, other than on foot. We were told
that a landowner in the area was ready and willing to clear out a
roadway to each of these parcels, and that he fully expected that this
work would be done in the upcoming summer, although maybe that we would
have to urge him to do so.</p>

<p><em>Position on the globe.</em></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>So we hiked off the roadway, through the lush forest, which was full
of ferns, moist soil, marsh and spruce trees, to find what might have
been our new home. As we got further from the road, it became
increasingly more beautiful. It was on a mountainside, which had views
down into the bowl between mountain ridges, to a creek that was fed by
seasonal streams, fed by melting snow. Further down the creek a gorge is
carved out, and finally Potter Creek empties into Potter Marsh, an
incredibly well known marshland that is a bird sanctuary, making up part
of the Anchorage Coastal Wildlife Refuge. Backdrops to this creek
emptying out into the marsh, and the inlet, and what looks like a vast
bay or ocean, are ridelines and rocky peaks, and one peak in particular
that stands out like a pyramid, called McHugh Peak.</p>
<p><img class="ui huge center image transition visible"   src="view-of-mchugh-peak-from-upper-potter-valley.jpg" /></p>
<p>Our guide, or realtor, carrying heavy weaponry that was very obvious,
took us from one spot to another, each of which would have be an amazing
location to have a home. As long as a road could be put in to get to it.
Some spots had clear views of the vistas, while others didn’t; but all
had their charm. Closer and closer to the park, we found the views to
become more and more spectacular and open. At one point in our
adventure, “house hunting” in the backwoods, which is really just an
Anchorage suburb somehow, he pointed out a piece of land completely
across the valley. Down to the creek, and back upwards near the other
ridge. Maybe a distance of three quarters of a mile to one mile away.
There was a driveway already there, and it was well made. It gave
complete access to the other parcels on that side of the valley. He said
that the views from that property were even more incredible. Spectacular
even.</p>
<p><img class="ui huge center image transition visible"   src="parcel-description-cavanaugh-property-platt.png" /></p>
<p>Kim and I thought about it, and realized that we thought it was
really unlikely that a road would be built to give us access to the
parcels that he showed us. We thought it would be a much better idea to
get a property that already had access, so we were curious to see this
other piece of land. But there was an issue—it was much larger and much
more costly than what we were aiming for, with our quest to have a cost
free “early retirement like” lifestyle. There were two parcels, one that
crossed completely across the valley (including positions on both sides
which was an amazing feature), that had a home placed on five acres,
awkwardly towards the center of the property. It completely encompassed
the smaller property in the center that was like an enclave to the
larger property. And it was fairly marshy, being in the lower portion of
the valley where all the water would drain by the creek. But there was
another property, slightly larger, at 80 acres, that was up higher on
the other mountainside, which was bisected by the roadway, meaning it
had complete access to many portions of the property. Once we heard
that, and saw it from that side of the valley, we were eager to take
another look, and scheduled time to go back out with John. This time, we
wouldn’t be hiking through the forest, armed and wondering if bears were
lurking about. There was plenty of wilderness and territory for wild
animals on 80 full acres, but this time we would have a roadway to drive
through, to take a look and see if it was worth becoming our new
homesite.</p>
<p><a name="seeing-the-80-acre-parcel-for-the-first-time"></a></p>
<h2 id="chapter-8.-seeing-the-80-acre-parcel-for-the-first-time">Chapter
8. Seeing the 80 Acre Parcel for the first time</h2>
<p>Not long after we saw the 2.5 acre lots on the one side of the
valley, we went with John to visit this other parcel on the other
side.</p>
<p>From the other side of the valley, it was possible to see the road
traversing this parcel and the other properties. The side of the
mountain was completely undeveloped, so the well worn, well built
pathway cutting a terrace along the slope was very clearly visible,
probably from almost any vantage point not blocked by trees. Our realtor
insisted that this property had stunning views that were an incredible
sight, so we were looking forward to just having the experience, which
would give us a unique view of the courntryside, just like our little
excursion, off the roadways to see the other remote pieces of land.</p>
<p>At that time, we didn’t think we needed more than an acre. The two
and a half acre parcels that we already saw were already quite large,
and offered plenty of privacy and natural surroundings, and were larger
than most people had where we were from in the more rural suburban
locations in Maryland we were more familiar with.</p>
<p>Before we could view the property, we were told we needed to have
permission from the owner who had the property near the gate. I don’t
recall if we obtained permission for him at that time, or if we obtained
permission afterwards, in order to see the property on our own, but
either way, it was clear that we had a neighbor who would be concerned
about his property rights, and access across his parcel. Frank Pugh, the
owner of this 120 acre property, had a secure gate and cameras at the
entrance of this property, that was locked with a chain and a pair of
interconnected padlocks. One padlock had a combination that our realtor
had, since he was given permission, and he was able to let us through.
At a later time we learned, that this gate was not the original gate.
After learning that, it became more obvious on inspection: the original
gate was a swing gate that you might see at the entrances of farm
driveways or parks in many locations across the United States. While
these close and lock, blocking vehicular traffic, they are really easy
to bypass or walk over. Because of some issues that I will explain
later, it became important for the owner to fortify this gate, even to
prevent foot traffic. So he welded numerous pieces of rebar (inexpensive
steel poles you often see inside of concrete blocks at construction
sites for construction), to make it more fence-like, and much taller. At
the top, there are pieces of rebar pointed outward, with barbed wire,
which makes it resemble a fence at a location where security is more
important. It doesn’t go so far as to have razor wire, and really does
not look like overkill for the purpose of keeping people out, but it is
significantly more protected than it was with the regular gate
construction, that apparently predated even his ownership of the
property.</p>
<p>While we were a little more cautious, or at least more perceptive
about the need for privacy, we had no worries or reservations about the
value of the property we were going to be seeing. Instead, it was quite
nice to know that it was a private driveway, and that there was a
measure of security, and limited traffic. In some ways, the property
seemed more like a property within a gated community on a golf course. A
private resort of sorts, except instead of a luxury golf course, this
had views and access to a high quality state park, with protection
against anyone and everyone coming through who might create some
security threat.</p>
<p>We parked our cars outside this gate, which is another thing the
nieghbors are not happy about, and took the realtors car to see the lot.
We had to pass through about 1 kilometer of our neighbor’s property
before getting to the beginning of the parcel we were viewing, and the
driveway proceeds another kilometer to the end, where there was a
staging area of sorts, and an oblong, culdesac like portion of the
driveway, where there were two pathways that could be used. At the end
of this culdesac (which wasn’t a culdesac really, because the road went
through one other parcel, before finally reaching the endpoint closer to
the park), was a large rusted pipesticking out of the ground, apparently
marking the end boundary. At the time, however, it was not obvious that
it had no function.</p>
<p>While driving along this path, which is on a cleared terrace, which
is much like other backgrounds that follow the side of a mountain, was
on a slope, which had a steep dropoff in some points on the right side,
and a mountain ridge on the left. Straight forward along the path one
could see McHugh Peak towering in the distance, perhaps a couple miles
away. It feels very close, and looms like a massive wall, although it is
still some distance away, and one can tell because of the small size of
the trees, and the intricate detail of the rocks and scree in the higher
elevations. It creates that awesome feeling, in that you can see that
there is so much there, but you can only vaguely mark out all the
detail, even though the textures and colors still feel clearly visible.
It is so large and so detailed that it is impossible to take it all in,
but it still feels close for inspection. In the opposite direction, down
the valley and outward, is the vast water body of Turnagain Arm, which
is the water body wrapping the peninsula like protrusion that Anchorage
proper creates. Also in the distance, below, one can see the famous
Potter Marsh preserve, and Seward highway, with little cars driving
along it, small and quiet, not at all disturbing the environment with
any sounds, providing the only access south of the city of Anchorage in
Alaska. One can also see the vast mudflats, which in the winter are
overtaken by ice, and chunks of ice, and other materials, give the edge
of the beaches below a variety of intricate designs, sometimes looking
fractal in nature, or otherwise regular and irregular simultaneously,
making the view of the water a far from monotonous thing to look at.</p>
<p>As we were driving, I honestly felt like I needed to write out a
check. My wife would probably laugh today, at my readiness to reserve
this property with a deposit. I was ready to write it on the spot, and
my realtor had to interject, basically to say there was no need, and I
could provide a deposit later. That was on our exit. I wasn’t totally
certain I wanted to buy the property, but I was certain I wanted to give
myself the time to be able to purchase it, if I wanted to, without
anyone else having the opportunity to snatch it in the meantime.</p>
<p>The views were more spectacular than we expected. And the ride back
in the opposite direction is of an entirely different character and
perspective, than the drive in, and at least as valuable in terms of
scenery. Most of the houses in the nearby neighborhood, which are little
over a mile away, look in one direction, out towards the ocean. Homes on
the lower portion of the valley, had really beautiful views of the more
heavily wooded areas, and views, from various perspectives, of the
mountains around, and some also had a view of the water also. But what
nearly all of them lacked, in this particular area, was a view of McHugh
peak and the ridges at the back, and the water in the front, the creek
running along the bottom of the valley <em>and</em> Potter Marsh below.
When I was there, I felt like I was on a multi-million dollar property
in the making, and couldn’t believe it was being offered at the price it
was being offered at, which was recently 400,000 dollars, and recently
brought down to $390,000. I could imagine Warren Buffet, Bill Gates, or
other magnate building a gigantic mansion in to the side of the
mountain, with the slope providing southerly views, and year-round
sunshine (even in the winter, for the short period of time that the sun
is out), with views of the mountain to the left, and views of the water
to the right. But there is a lot of land in Alaska, and it is much
easier to procure land there, than elsewhere, In Maryland, 80 acres, in
a “hillside community” equal in elitism, would cost around 80 million
dollars, and these views would not exist <em>at all</em>.</p>
<p>Long story short, there were definitely some concerns with this
property. It wasn’t the scenery that was the problem, or the quality and
buildability of the land. It was all zoned residential. The problem was
the history, and the people, and the legal contention over the driveway,
and maybe other parts of the property, that long antedated my interest
in purchasing it. But it was not immediately obvious, at the time, that
any issues with strangers or neighbors, would culminate in any costly
issues. It just seemed like a place that was so beautiful, that even
neighbors and people nearby, who already owned beautiful homes and
properties themselves, in excess of the cost of this property, still
wanted to walk to get a view of the wildlife and nature.</p>
<p>Chugach Sate Park was a couple miles away from the gate, but
everything past the gate, is as beautiful as the park. And that’s why
people wanted to get through the gate, and was also the reason why my
neighbor needed to lock it up.</p>
<p>After looking things over with Kim, and getting back to the gate, and
anxiously trying to hand my realtor a deposit, to reserve this gorgeous
property, Kim and I really started to wonder if we really should buy the
80 acres instead of the 2.5 that we were looking at. We were there to
retire. We were in it for the frugality. But 2.5 acres at just under
50,000, compared to 80 acres at 8 times that price, seemed reasonable.
It wasn’t what we were looking for, but maybe it was far better than
what we ever thought was possible? We could afford it and so we
seriously started to consider buying this property, because it had a
hold on us the moment we saw it.</p>
<p>We were in Alaska for the nature, not just for the RV or tiny house
life. Not only to realize the plans we had for so long. And what better
place would we find, than one that had the closest possible position to
the state park, and private access, along a high quality driveway that
was already built for us to use?</p>

<p>Much is taken for granted living in normal homes and apartments,
which are designed to be stable, comfortable, according to building
standards that are not necessarily recognized for what they contribute
to our daily lives. This fact becomes slowly, and depending on the
situation even painfully apparent, when one departs from the norm. There
is a reason why it can be characterized as an adventure, to shift from a
normal lifestyle to a tiny-house or RV lifestyle, or any alternative
lifestyle departing significantly from the norm.</p>
<p>After spending some time in Anchorage, living in an Apartment with
the RV that I arrived in stored and covered beside it, we decided it was
time to try out living in the RV, even if not on a piece of land, to get
the experience needed to make the big switch. We bought our land, but we
could not yet develop it. After buying the land, we questioned the costs
of having an apartment. We needed to take the steps necessary to get
closer to living on the land itself, without having to pay duplicate
monthly fees for both locations. We decided to move out of Anchorage, to
an RV park that was willing to have long-term renters, even over the
winter, in a safe and stable location we knew already from our first
travels (we stayed there for a few weeks and loved it), in Palmer
Alaska.</p>
<p>Palmer, Alaska is a gorgeous location, worthy of the tourism it
receives as a prominent location on a northwest system of roadways,
connecting Homer to the far south (where some of “Deadliest Catch” was
filmed, with Prudhoe Bay, off the Dalton Highway, to the far north on
the Arctic Coast, where “Ice Road Truckers” was filmed in part. This
location, along the way, is beautiful, considering all that can be saw
along that entire roadway system, and I have been along this entire
course, which is 1,072 miles, which may give some indication of the
massive state that Alaska really is.</p>
<p>Even after many years living in Alaska, Palmer is no less spectacular
than on first arrival. It sits in the Matanuska-Susitna Valley, between
two rivers coming from the north and east, approximately 40 minutes
north of Wasilla. This valley is very close to sea level, but has
towering mountains on two sides, that are very rugged and rocky in
appearance, and covered by snow for much of the year. Between these
mountain ranges, in the distance, on a clear day, one can see more
glaciated mountains, which are white with snow all year long. Wind blows
between these mountains, into the valley, making it a windy location
from time to time, which affected us, living in our new spot. The area
is also very agricultural, which might come as a surprise to
non-residents, but there are many farms, and they are highly productive,
some with record size pumpkins and other fall/winter crops that benefit
from a short but extremely sunny season of growth.</p>
<p>This RV park, called Big Bear RV Park, was a wonderful place to stay.
It was quiet, and the people there were calm and relaxed. The facilities
were clean, and we had bathrooms, showers, electrical hookups, and
sewers that would make our stay straightforward and simple. The two
drawbacks, given our situation, was that we would have to pay nearly the
same rent that we would pay for an apartment, and even more, if one
included the propane tank and fuel we required during the winter, and
the electricity; and that we were not really off grid, but living more
like a mobile RV lifestyle. We also had a long drive into Anchorage to
get Kim to her work location, which was still in Anchorage.</p>
<p>By this time, we had already experienced RV/Tiny House style living
in the Desert, in the swampy and humid climate of Florida, the Mountains
of Canada, and many places in between. So we knew very well how to do
the day-to-day tasks in an RV Park. What we did not know how to do yet,
and we knew it would not be really easy, was live in an RV in the
winter. We hardly tested our propane heater system, and never did all of
the weatherization necessary to live in it during the winter, and not
just store it during the winter, like we had to do when we were living
in our apartment.</p>
<p>To make a long story short, we learned the hard way, and were tested
in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>The need to weatherize the RV, due to having nothing insulated
underneath.</li>
<li>Gusting cold winds upwards of 80mph, coming from various directions,
but roughly from the same source, for days during the winter.</li>
<li>Subzero temperatures well below -10 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
<li>The need to heat the water lines, and to protect the sewer lines,
both which are prone to freezing.</li>
<li>Insulating the windows, with the result of having even less sunlight
coming into the home in the darkness of winter.</li>
<li>Living in a location that really is not at all suitable for normal
residential conditions in the winter.</li>
<li>Noticing, viewing behavior of neighbors, that RV park living does
not feel entirely stable and safe, even in a nicer RV park. One starts
to notice the small details in such a life, and people tend to be
suspicious, because people who appear to be more transient are looked at
with more suspicion.</li>
</ul>
<p>Coming from living in beautiful apartment complexes, approaching
resort living, in Miami Beach, Charlotte, NC, and McLean, Virginia, this
was quite a transition!</p>
<p>The biggest difference between living in a Tiny Home, or an RV, is
the likelihood that the construction is for mobile transport, and that
it is designed to sit above the surface of the ground, atop wheels, or
some other supports. For RVs this is a given; but for tiny homes, it is
optional to an extent. Many tiny houses are designed to sit atop
inexpensive trailer beds/platforms, so that they can be periodically
moved into place as well. But, for tiny homes, if one chooses a location
and wishes to make it permanent, it may be possible to transition the
structure from siting on a trailer bed, to sitting on a normal
foundation on the ground. Since tiny houses are like normal houses in
construction in various ways, and are customized, one has considerable
flexibility in what one can choose to achieve regarding this, as long as
one doesn’t design oneself into a stuck position (i.e. permanently
mounts it in a way that makes it hard to remove from a trailer bed).
Either way, RVs are mobile, and Tiny Houses are often built and
transported, and so do not have permanent foundations in many
situations.</p>
<p>One could bypass the considerations below, by procuring land, and
opting out of the more flexible mobile lifestyle, by buying a normal
mobile home that is set on a foundation, or by building a more permanent
cabin, cottage, small home, or tiny house, in a place where it will not
be moved. Tiny house living is not new; there are many names to small
getaway homes. People even live in sheds and caches. What is different
is the quality of the construction, and the desire to live in a mobile
and flexible way, with few possessions, costs, etc… to attain maximum
freedom. So if one wants to live a tiny house lifestyle, one could
easily opt to take another pathway and achieve the same.</p>
<p>This is what we did. We decided that an RV was a tiny home, just with
a higher degree of fabrication, and ease of transport since they are
designed for roadway travel from the start, and are already aerodynamic,
tested for the road, with published limits on weight etc… and easy
connection to trucks according to methods that are interchangeable and
well understood.</p>
<p>By having a home that is mobile, and mounted permanently to a mobile
trailer chassis, the RV will always sit over a foot above the ground,
with plenty of space for air to pass underneath. If you were to ask me
what this would mean for living in Alaska before I purchased it, I would
have no idea. Maybe heat would be sucked out by the cold air passing
underneath? That turns out to be true. I could figure that out coming
from the fireplace and home heating industry. But there were many other
things I would not have thought of.</p>
<p>Here are some of many examples. Firstly, if you actually go
underneath an RV, and pull away the materials that cover the bottom, you
will likely find, as I did, that everything is basically exposed with
hardly any protection at all. RVs make manufacturers a lot of money.
They are listed at very high prices, that still seem cheap compared to
normal homes, when one first starts shopping for them. Even better,
there is considerable latitude to negotiate a lower price. When we came
to the final cost of our RV, we were shocked it was even possible. It
had a kitchen, bathroom, entertainment system, furniture, AC unit,
heater, etc.. etc.., nearly endlessly. It has 3 pop-outs that expand to
give it a larger living space, that open and close like what one sees on
TV for motorhomes used by famous people. But it turns out, after living
in an RV, that everything is much cheaper than it appears. And of all
places one can look to see how inexpensive the construction is, one
should look <em>underneath</em>. This is where no one thinks to look,
and as a result, is no-frills, because it has no part in the sales
process. The goal is to show a beautiful living space, with mostly
everything that you could need; and not to highlight that underneath
there is no insulation. Sewer pipes and water lines, that are really
cheaply constructed, are just in the open, which is <em>completely</em>
unlike the construction of a normal home.</p>
<p>Electrical lines, HVAC tubes transporting heat from the furnace, are
exposed and are really cheap. The heating tubes, on inspection, in my
RV, were like foil tubes, that one could rip in half if one wanted to.
The protective material covering the undercarriage was just a thin
fabric cover, which I could hardly believe held up in the 10,000 mile
plus trip across the united states, with all that can happen on the
road, underneath the vehicle.</p>
<p>If one does research about cold weather environments, one immediately
finds that RVs are not designed for them. That they definitely need work
to prepare for winter, and that winter weather packages are available to
make life easier, but not for life well below zero in really cold
climates. Furthermore, while they are adequate to live in in many ways,
the biggest tell is that life is considered “camping” in an RV, which
sounds ridiculously contradictory. It has everything that a hotel room
seems to have, so how can one consider it camping? That it is called
“camping” should not be dwelt on. Instead, one should just look at the
red flag, that it is not <em>permanent</em>, and that it is not a
<em>residential dwelling</em>. “Camping” means “cheap, and inadequate”
for permanent living.</p>
<p>Now much of this can be overcome, but what is interesting is that it
<em>must</em> be overcome with work and planning. An RV only becomes a
suitable replacement for a tiny house, or permanent house on a
foundation, with work.</p>
<p>I mentioned that in Palmer, AK, in this location, we would experience
80mph gusts of wind for days. 80 mph freezing subzero air underneath an
RV will definitely do the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Freeze water lines,</li>
<li>Freeze sewer lines,</li>
<li>Break unwinterized water heaters,</li>
<li>and suck all the heat from the bottom of the RV,</li>
<li>and create really cold, uncomfortable floors.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is what happens if one does nothing. What can one do to prevent
this?</p>
<p>RV skirting.</p>
<p>The process is really straightforward, but takes a fair amount of
work. The good thing, however, is after one winter, one knows how to do
it forever. That was why this experience, while it was at an RV park,
still provide really good learning opportunities for what would come
later, when the RV was placed on Vacant land. By the time I had the RV
on the vacant land, I had a really good idea about what winterization
would consist of, and what level of preparation I cared to take. Some
things I cared about before, I didn’t care about later. Somethings I
knew were vital, and needed to be dealt with. But the work to be done
was the same. It amounted to covering the bottom of the RV in a cheap
but effective way, and to insulate wherever and however one wanted to,
for the level of functioning one did not want to give up.</p>
<p>So while at the RV Park, I learned the skirting process. The simplest
possible way to do this, I found, was to buy thick insulated board from
the hardware/lumber store, and hand cut them into panels that would
cover the gap between the RV’s body and the ground. It is necessary to
buy a large number of panels to be sure that the gap is covered. Panels
are better if they are thicker than 1/2 inch, to be sure they are
stable, and do not shake lose during the winter. I got panels that were
closer to 3/4” thick, and even doubled them up in locations so there was
added stability. I then taped—and yes, you hear that right, I
<em>taped</em> these panels to the RV using heavy aluminum tape, which
is rated to well below zero. I chose aluminum tape that was graded to
-40 degrees Fahrenheit, and this turned out to be more than adequate.
Through this experience, I discovered a love for this tape! It is highly
adhesive, holds under high winds, and really cold conditions, and is
easy to tear and apply. It’s expensive at upwards of $30 dollars a role,
but has many applications, and save an incredible amount of work. With
tape like this, and panels, and experience, it is possible to do all of
the work in a single day. Without experience, I would plan for three
days to do perform all of the steps without cutting too many
corners.</p>
<p>The tops of the panels were taped to the RV, but that left the
bottoms to deal with. My neighbor at the RV park had a system for
creating wood framing underneath the RV, in which to affix the panels.
This makes the panels really sturdy, and resistant to the wind. I
trusted his opinion and method because he lived in that location for
more than one winter. I looked at his work, and results, to guide me in
my approach. However, I opted to not use any wood framing, and had
considerable success as well, with much less work and cost. What I opted
to do, is buy many long galvanized steel 10” spikes (later I bought
longer ones, but these were excellent), and I hammered them into the
ground, in front and behind each panel, to create pressure in both
directions, holding the panels in place. I left only approximately an
inch and a half, or an amount approaching that, for all spikes around
the panels, around the RV. This worked surprisingly well to hold the
panels in place, and survived the entire winter, even with the 80 mph
hour winds. I don’t think there is a better, easier, or more effective
option than this, that requires less thought or planning. I can think of
some methods, like using rope, or truck tie downs, around the whole RV,
securing all planks together tightly, as another method that might
provide even more protection; but I don’t think I would do this without
also pinning the panels to the ground with these spikes that could be
re-used over and over again.</p>
<p>I still have spikes and these panels to use in case I want to
winterize the RV the same way in the future.</p>
<p>While I did much right doing this work, I did not do it <em>fast
enough</em>. I could have done it all in a couple days. But instead, I
did the front of the RV (the most important part) and half of the sides,
over the course of two days, if I recall correctly. But I left the back
exposed, with plans to do the same work, at a time that it happened to
snow. And ti got cold, it snowed <em>a lot</em>.</p>
<p>Suddenly, by doing half of the work, I had a half winterized RV. It
was mostly OK, except for the sewer line, which froze, leaving the dirty
task of unthawing a pipe that was frozen with urine and “grey water”
which amounts to sewer water that does not have raw sewage in it (think
of kitchen water, from dirty dishes, and hand washing). We did not
choose to use the bathroom for feces, which is what creates black water.
Instead, we used the facilities of the RV park for that. And to make
things simple, we used the showers in the facilities too. Off grid, we
would not have these facilities, and this causes problems, but under
these conditions, we could choose to make life a little easier and not
winterize or plan to do these things in the RV itself. But we did use
the toilet for urine, since it would be really annoying to have to leave
the RV, already equipped with a bathroom, to pee every single time.</p>
<p>Can you tell that RV living is already starting to seem unlike living
in the comfort of a real home? Especially in the winter?</p>
<p>So I started to experience issues with the sewer lines, from freezing
cold air, and just cold temperatures, that came from the back of the
RV.</p>
<p>The goal, I discovered, is not merely to have a well insulated RV
underneath, but to find a way to <em>heat the underside of the RV!</em>.
This is because, the RV is not designed to heat <em>the outside of the
RV</em>, in the undercarriage. Which makes perfect sense. You spend
yourself the box sitting on top of the wheels, not underneath! So in the
winter, if you create <em>more box underneath</em>, that will insulate
the pipes, you need to think about how those pipes will remain
heated.</p>
<p>You can achieve that, by creating an additional outlet of the heating
tubes, from the main heater, into that newly created crawlspace of
sorts, that exists after adding the insulation. I did not do this. In
fact, I did not do much of anything aside form insulate it, and that is
inadequate. So what I ended up doing, whenever it got cold enough to
freeze the pipes (which were heated to some extent by heat form inside
the RV, emanating outwards, and by convection from the inside), I would
use some form of electric heat temporarily underneath. One can use a
space heater for this purpose. I temporarily used a heating lamp, while
doing work to unthaw sewer lines (which worked well and provided light
to see while working), and a space heater. These were both temporary
solutions for doing the troubleshooting work, and are not good permanent
solutions. Permanent solutions are certainly desirable. I learned this
the hard way, as I came across real obstacles, and would definitely
advise to reroute heat from the heater, into the space underneath, and
expect to have greater heating expenses because of it, but also probably
warmer floor boards and a better experience overall.</p>
<p>Another thing, that I found, was that something that we learn as
children playing in the snow. When it snowed, it actually <em>took
care</em> of some of our insulation needs. It did not feel as cold
inside, and seemed to help with the insulation in the underside of the
RV.</p>
<p>This is the principle used in temporary shelters used in the winter,
like with ice caves and with igloos, which I had some experience
creating, simply through play in my backyard, when we would experience
heavy snowfall in the Maryland area outside of D.C. Interestingly
enough, the harsher winters, with greater amounts of snowfall, apart
from this experience in Palmer, which was much longer in duration, and
darker, was in Maryland. We had times where we had nearly 4 feet of
snow, that stuck around for very long periods of time. I remember
digging out our driveway in these conditions and having feet of snow on
both sides afterwards. We would dig half-pipe like tunnels down a hill
beside our house, and sled down it during the winter. We would also dig
places to play and feel warm in the snow, and make small ice caves, and
poorly constructed igloos as well, that we would stay in for hours to
feel warm. Sometimes, we would pour water over top o these shelters to
crate a crust of ice that would make it more durable and last longer, as
the snow melted.</p>
<p>Knowing this information, and experiencing the insulating properties
of the snow, I noticed one day that I could cover the remaining gap that
I left in the back of the RV with chunks of snow. As the snow came to be
compressed over time, and after loose snow was blown away by heavy
winds, I used my kukri knife, which is like a curved, slighly shorter
machete, to cut chunks large chunks of snow and ice, to lay against the
RV, to cover the air space. I did this around much of the exposed area,
in an unplanned way, that ended making my RV look like it was
half-winterized, and half really poorly cosntucted pseudo-igloo. It was
funny. It worked, but not really well. It lasted maybe a week, until,
unfortunately, much warmer weather suddenly appeared. However, if it was
like many winters, like the one I just experienced this year, with more
snowfall, and colder conditions, it would have been a decent temporary
solution for a long time. Maybe months.</p>
<p>Mostly it was fun. Once it snowed, it was not an easy task to attempt
to add the remaining panels. But it was easy to add chunks of snow, to
the snow that already accumulated near the RV. As I added snow, the
children living temporarily in the large RV beside ours, became excited
and started to do the same. They also did not have their RV thoroughly
winterized RV, and added supplementary snow chunks. Which is another
thing—even if you <em>do</em> perfectly winterize the RV, you can have
some fun can cover the panels with ice chunks to make it like a half-RV
half igloo for the winter.</p>
<p>Oh and those children that lived in the RV next door. There were
five, including a very young child/baby, and a teenage girl, for a total
family of seven, living in an RV that couldn’t be more than 400 square
feet, beside us most of the winter! Kim and I thought that must have
been hard! We were not getting along much of the time by that point, and
while it wasn’t too difficult to live that way for the two of us, it was
not very comfortable. It must have been really uncomfortable for
<em>them</em>, although by all appearances, they seemed to be doing just
fine, and they were really quiet and well behaved. Quieter than we were,
if I’m not mistaken.</p>
<p>Living in an RV can work, and work really well, in many climates
across the US. While using the RV in places like New Mexico and Arizona,
it was really easy! Very home like in may RV parks as well. Virtually no
work needed to get done, and RV parks were like mini resorts. The only
odd thing about it was, we were really young by comparison to most
people living that lifestyle. Others were much older. It made it feel
safe, and secure, since these people were not really interested in
difficult lifestyles, and were not in anyway looking to live in a
dangerous living environment.</p>
<p>In Alaska, unfortunately, especially in the winter, it does not feel
this way.</p>
<p>People living in this situation, are willing to put up with sever
winters, with less security, for a reason. They were facing personal
hardships, or had less money or flexibility, or were in between more
comfortable situations (maybe like us), which doesn’t necessarily signal
danger, but does signal insecurity, and people do show discomfort.</p>
<p>An RV is usually a luxury. It is something people have to enjoy a
life of leisure and travel. In the summers, and in good climates, RV
parks look like places where people have money. The have toys and are
enjoying them. RVs clean, and big, and complement often high-end trucks,
and sit beside motorhomes that may cost many hundreds of thousands of
dollars.</p>
<p>In Alaska, in the winter, by contrast, you have RVs that otherwise
would look like luxury vehicles, half winterized with insulating board,
making them look more like temporary shacks, and unfinished homes,
exposed to elements without paint or anything that looks complete,
converting a situation that could be a show money, to maybe a show of
poverty.</p>
<p>We were not at all impoverished. But suddenly, were in a situation
that maybe looked like we were. We didn’t fit in. It didn’t feel normal.
And we had to reassure ourselves, that this was a learning experience.
We didn’t need much, and were used to living frugally, in small
apartments, even though sometimes they were quite nice or had amenities.
But were were fine with few things, few possessions, lived on the road
before, and so could get through it without feeling our lives had
changed too dramatically. In retrospect though, we were in a lot of
discomfort, and I don’t think many other people would be nearly as ready
to feel normal, or endure that situation. Most would have decided it was
just not a good idea, maybe before even starting.</p>
<p>Several years later, however, I can also say, I learned so much from
that situation, that I have the skills, knowledge, and resources to
better decide how to be comfortable, or just what matters and what
doesn’t for a whole bunch of situations, I could encounter living off
grid. And if you think this sounded uncomfortable, it was
<em>nothing</em> compared to what I was going to soon experience, once I
moved the RV from the RV park, to the property.</p>
<p><a name="strangers-and-neighbors"></a></p>
<h2 id="chapter-11.-strangers-and-neighbors">Chapter 11. Strangers and
Neighbors</h2>
<p>Not long after moving onto the property did we start to naturally
come into contact with neighbors. One neighbor was kind enough to offer
to meet her at her home, that she built herself with her husband, before
they separated. She was a bit older than ourselves, perhaps in her early
sixties, although it’s not quite clear (she declined to be interviewed).
She was a former iditerod contender, which is the most well-known
dogsled race, covering over a thousand miles from Willow, Alaska, to
Nome, Alaska, on the far west coast of the state, right near the Bering
Sea, which separates the United States from Russia (and supposedly was
the point of migration for Native Peoples across the land bridge, when
the ice made it possible to cross over land from Asia to North America;
although this hypothesis is now being questioned). The fact that she was
a real Iditerod contender was fascinating to us, and made us wonder what
other neighbors we might have. We did join her at her home, and were
given a tour of her home, and were happy at being welcomed by somebody.
She was a friend of our immediate neighbor, Frank, who we already met in
the process of buying the property.</p>
<p>While we found our visit with her to be very nice, and appreciated,
we did get mixed signals as to whether or not she was supportive with
respect to our property rights. She did not seem to interested in using
our driveway for access to Chugach, but it was clear that she did have
some friends who were interested in gaining access. But more
importantly, for some years prior, she trimmed and groomed a trail that
covered a lower portion of the property that started from Frank’s, and
passed roughly a quarter mile through my tract, before ultimately
exiting into another property nearby. She seemed really Interested in
continuing to maintain this trail, for mostly unknown reasons. She was
older, and presumably, she was able to get out more and get some
exercise. We welcomed here and assured her that she would continue to
have access, because she was concerned that someone would ultimately
block it off, and anticipated that some day that might happen, and like
others, she wasn’t looking forward to that day. So for two summers I
gave her permission to trim the trails, and said she could walk along
that trail if she wanted.</p>
<p>Most new contacts were with folks along our driveway, which were
usually very uncomfortable, unfortunately. Instead of being welcomed, we
were either ignored, or were questioned about why we were there, or why
we were able to drive through, given there was a locked gate at the
entrance. We would have to explain that we were new owners of property
up the road and that we had access, and that while we were accepting of
people passing through, we did want to have agreements that were in
keeping with those that our neighbor Frank was already collecting. So we
didn’t hinder anyone from passing through, but were perturbed about the
anxiety that we found some people in, or the disingenuousness of their
welcomes, and the excess curiosity they had about how much land we
procured, and what our plans were. Upon relaying our plans, to have a
small home to live in, we were greeted with distrust and disbelief; as
though our true intentions were to develop the property to a more
substantial degree, or find a way to block their access permanently.
Most folks who passed through were people who lived nearby, although
some did not, and were not very clear about where they were coming from.
There were others who arrived at the gate, somewhat sketchy in
appearance, only to depart.</p>
<p>Overall, we became increasingly annoyed and worried about who our
neighbors were, and what their interest was.</p>
<p>Frank, our neighbor, was already well aware of many of the neighbors,
and explained to us before, that while many were willing to sign
agreements, many others were not interested, and suspected that signing
anything would somehow lead to their being permanently blocked from use
of the pathway at a later date. Around this time I consulted a lawyer
who explained that this perspective was legal in basis, and concerned
the requirement of “Hostile use” for obtaining a prescriptive easement.
“Hostile use” he explained immediately, is not about being “hostile” in
any way, although many walkers appear to be confused on this point.
Instead, it is about showing disregard for the landowner’s claim to the
property, such that it is made clear by the path user, that they have a
claim of their own to the property. This makes sense, from the
perspective of Westward Expansion, and times when there were vast chunks
of vacant land owned by magnates or others who rarely ever went there,
which was around, on, or near people who actively lived on or used the
land. For example, if aboriginal people’s, or Native Americans, used
tracts of land, and paths, to obtain water, or other necessities, from
tracts they owned, after a period of time it would become reasonable to
conclude that they required continue use of the pathway as a dependency
of sorts. If landowners were vacant, and apparently didn’t care about
access, and didn’t give permission, one way or another, to users of the
pathways, they could end up having to provide access. Access does not in
this case mean giving up the land entirely, although certain used along
the easement would then become somewhat difficult or prohibitive.
“Easement by prescription” amounts to “Because of your prior use, you
prescriptively attained rights to pass through, to gain an easement”,
and the easement is provided through court judgment.</p>
<p>States vary in how a prescriptive easement is gained, but in all
cases I’ve seen in my research, including for the State of Alaska, court
order is required and there must be a history of roughly continuous
hostile use. In the present case I’m facing, folks who walk through my
property, trespassing, will need to show that they had no less than ten
years of roughly continuous use, along with other factors that I cannot
mention because I cannot share every costly legal detail publicly
(lawyers and research are costly, which is what I tell neighbors when
they pry too much). The biggest downside to this is that they aren’t
merely trying to gain permanent access for themselves. Once a
prescriptive easement is gained, it entails public access for that use.
Meaning, since they want access for themselves to walk through to the
park, everyone who wants that same access is entitled to that. For
myself, and my neighbor, it doesn’t sound so bad to have these neighbors
pass through, except perhaps those who are most disrespectful and
wontonly trespass, even during court proceedings; but it does sound
quite bad indeed to have many strangers from all around crime-ridden
anchorage passing through, and teenagers at night, and random people
from tour buses from all across the united states, and elsewhere,
arriving as tourists.</p>
<p>Another way to put it. Our road in some ways seems like a natural
destination on an outskirt of a city to 1) dump bodies, 2) trash the
place, or 3) congregate without any onlookers without driving too far.
In many ways it’s like a country road outside of Las Vegas, where in the
movies people are brought to be executed and left behind. Without
completely public access, and a gate, however, it just seems like a nice
neighborly path and private community, safe and protected like those in
the areas immediately surrounding the gate. The gate just blocked entry
to a location that went out where nobody could see, by a private park,
with no lights, where anyone could go without the gate, and do things
without detection. It didn’t even end all of the way at the park, it
ended near the park, but not quite there. Another vacant parcel at the
termination point that was privately owned blocked full access.</p>
<p>While it could be true that nearby landowners had other plans, it was
never shared with us what these plans might be. The goal of just having
access for hiking never rang true, and there seemed to be ulterior
motives around, having to do with additional development, and it seemed
to be true that money played a role, although that role was hidden and
not easily known. As mentioned earlier, it was curious that so many
politicians, officials, and notable figures were involved. Also,
landholding organizations were also in the mix, and there seemed to be
some interest that was known to a few, but not everyone. Certainly not
myself, my neighbor, or other landowners nearby who were impacted. That
is, unless they were not sharing information with us.</p>
<p>So we met many neighbors who simply were not very interested in
knowing us as neighbors. They simply wanted our plans and our legal
information. They gave us chilly welcomes, and left us feeling
threatened. Even our neighbor who welcomed us into her home seemed to
have conflicting interests, and only our Neighbor Frank seemed to share
precisely the same interests we did, although he also was protecting his
information about his goals, and was somewhat duplicitous at times in
his treatment of me versus his treatment of some favorite neighbors.
Nevertheless, I’ve been in alignment with him about our legal situation,
and we are co-defendants in this case. He’s primary, in my opinion,
because he instituted the gate, which precipitated the case. I’m mostly
an adversely impacted collateral damage victim.</p>
<p>Even after multiple years dealing with this situation, things have
not much improved. There are a few neighbors who seem much more
hospitable, but for a variety of reasons, including preoccupation with
work and divorce, and many other commitments, I haven’t been able to
develop relationships.</p>
<p>However, there is one, far more important thing I came to realize.
Gossip is a problem in Anchorage. Not only gossip: harassment and
ostracism. I soon became a victim of a level of ostracism that I found
so hard to believe, I didn’t even know it was happening. Later, I
realized it was the sort of thing that happens only when minorities are
being purged from a community, or people have things at stake, like
financial rewards, or other situations of political corruption, which
also became apparent since so many politicians are and were involved. It
took me a very long time to really realize it was entirely true that
this was the situation I was facing. I was always under stress in
Anchorage after buying the property anyplace I ever went, I’m
experiencing obvious harassment in Wasilla, where I now reside, since I
still cannot live on the property. The only relief I would experience,
is leaving town to a remote location, where finally I would
re-experience calm. As soon as I’m back in Alaska, an insidious stress
creeps in, and a level of open adverse gossip and verbal hostility that
seems impossible comes back into my life.</p>
<p>So while some neighbors even started to ask me “Why do you not have
more friends” and so on, or “Who are your friends” which are really off
putting questions to begin with, since I have friends scattered all over
the globe, and my work is not in the state, I came to the
conclusion:</p>
<p>Friends are dangerous to have in Alaska.</p>
<p>They are duplicitous. They tell your life to everyone else. They put
you at risk.</p>
<p>I could not afford to spend my free time with people I could not
trust, and I did attempt to do so on a number of occasions, only to be
disappointed by strange behaviors, similar to some that I mentioned
above, and worse. Although I’ll save more of that for a later chapter on
the specific harassments I’ve encountered, and unfortunately, had to
track.</p>

<p><img class="ui huge center image transition visible"   src="entering-private-property-cavanaugh.png" /><br /></p>
<p><strong><em>My First Entrance Sign Design</em></strong></p>
<p>It didn’t take long after purchasing the property to realize that I
would need to include no trespassing signs around the outer perimeter
and the main entrances; both at the location where people would enter my
portion of the shared driveway, and at the end, where they would exit
and need to re-enter once again.</p>
<p>It may seem as though only a few no trespassing signs would be
necessary, but it turns out, some are quite confused about what
constitutes sufficient signage, and in fact, it isn’t clear how much is
truly necessary to put an intruder on notice, that the property they are
entering is not someone else’s, or public land; Even though my property,
while close to the State Park, with no neighbors between myself and that
Park, in terms of people spending much time out there, am still
completely encircled by other private lots. In other words, trespassers
are well into private properties, trespassing on others land, by the
time they have ventured across my borders.</p>
<p>When I say border, I do almost imagine that I’m trying to bound and
surveil a small country enclave within the State of Alaska. It’s not far
from the truth, in terms of the amount of differences that exist between
myself and everyone else here. However, it also feels true, because it
seems as though I’ve got a long border to protect, and lots of people,
who for some reason, are intent in crossing through, making me want to
create a border wall of sorts, to keep out all of the “illegals”. (I
don’t at all think of immigrants without papers as “illegals” but I’m
not fond of the behavior of trespassers on my property so I like to
think of them as illegals to amuse myself. Well, as of writing this down
at least.)</p>
<p>They are now illegal immigrants when they come onto my property.</p>
<p>But more seriously, the circumference of the entire thing is 6,144
feet, which is over one mile in length. Much of that boundary is
impossible to walk, because of dense alder forests, which easily conceal
large bears in the summer time, especially in combination with
chest-high grasses surrounding and in between clusters of bushes. Other
parts of the property are very difficult to walk in a straight line
around the boundaries, for the same or similar reasons. The slope also
makes it challenging to walk, since it is taxing on legs, and it makes
for a high difficulty hike, or bushwhack of sorts. Additionally, there
is an elevation change of over 700 feet from top to bottom, and multiple
climate zones. The bottom of the property has many black spruce trees,
and a marshy environment, which is impassable in straight lines in the
summer, because of the water, mud and muck. Bears probably can cover a
distance in the muck without issue, so it isn’t the most comfortable
place to be walking around.</p>
<p>I have never made a walk around the edge of the property in a single
traversal because it really is that difficult or uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Adding No Trespassing signs along the boundaries of the property in
these conditions is very difficult, and not entirely necessary, it would
seem, because if trespassers would face the same issues, it’s not at all
clear that they need trespassing signs to keep them out. They want to
walk on trails like everyone else, to avoid crawling through bushes.
Although it does seem a bit humorous, to consider adding signs even in
these locations, for the remote possibility that someone crawling
around, or trying to find a path without being seen or noticed, would
still run into signs!</p>
<p>Not long after joining the community council, in my region of South
Anchorage, Rabbit Creek, I discovered that there are many members who
seem interested, if not bent, on knowing everything about any
development projects that are happening, or might be happening in the
area. Strangely enough (or maybe familiar enough to others), these nosy,
gossipy people, who enjoy interfering with the lives of others, are of
the more aged variety, some well into their seventies and eighties,
quite well off and not without beautiful properties of their own. They
spend there time reviewing their neighbor’s plans for permits, so that
they can actively oppose them if they see anything they don’t like, that
seems to contradict anything in <em>their</em> personal plans for the
community. Well, many of them share the same views, so they aren’t
entirely personal, but they don’t at all represent the bulk of the
community, who they hardly ever converse with. They are known for taking
action, including making anonymous complaints, or open complaints at the
council, and trespassing onto properties to snoop around and see what
they are up to. And they seem to feel quite entitled and behave smugly
as if there is nothing at all wrong with doing it.</p>
<p>On one occasion, a diminutive older woman who is quite nice to speak
with in person, one on one, when in a good mood, gave a short
presentation on a property that had a corner portion being developed
perhaps too close a stream, within a stream setback, which had to be a
certain distance away, based on Anchorage Municipal requirements. It
makes sense for the Municipality to approve or reject permits, or
enforce them, whenever they are out of compliance, within reason. There
are ways around permit issues, with variances and so on (although these
are actively opposed by these folks as well), so if their permit got
rejected, they would have possibilities. But this community council, and
some members, are not interested in letting the Municipality handle
these issues. This one woman, who is quite cantankerous, perhaps due to
anxieties, began telling the tale of how she discovered that they were
out of compliance, while out in the neighborhood snooping around. After
explaining how this property was building an extension too close to the
stream, she was questioned by my neighbor, who wondered how she was able
to see it from off the property. She then admitted, that she had, in
fact, walked out onto the property itself, to take a closer look.
Clearly, she was admitting, openly, that she was trespassing, and
astonishingly, many people in the council did not seem concerned, as
usual. My neighbor, however, continued to question her, about whether
she would observe No Trespassing signs, to which she replied, in a fit
of frustration, that No Trespassing signs, had to exist <em>every
ten</em> feet around a property. So it was her belief, or her excuse for
her behavior, that since such a plethora of signs did not exist, she
could ignore some signs and go wherever she wanted.</p>
<p>Now, imagine placing not less than 614 signs around my property?!
Certainly that was an absurdity, and there was no way I could afford to
spend time time creating that many signs, or placing them all, out in
locations where there aren’t even any trees, and posts would have to be
installed. Posts, 10 feet apart, closer than fence posts in some cases,
all with No Trespassing signs!</p>
<p>These were the neighbors I was dealing with. So whatever signs I
placed, they had to be visible, obvious, and in key location at
least.</p>
<p>Initially I installed really a couple really inexpensive and flimsy,
cheap aluminum signs from Home Depot, and wrote in black permanent
marker, a message about staying away, and about buying the property if
they were really interested in using so much. After not too long, I
found a couple of these signs were wiped, such that the messages, in
permanent marker, were completely removed. This was not by weathering,
and from future observation, it was not out of the ordinary to have
folks remove, damage, destroy, or otherwise deface signage.</p>
<p>Later, I decided it would be much more fun to have professional
signs. So I took the time to design my own signs, and order them at
significant cost to myself online. These signs had a large eyeball in
the center, to indicate that they should not feel as though they could
pass unobserved or without being surveilled. And, in fact, I followed my
neighbor’s lead, and purchased a number of trail cameras, and scattered
them around the property at locations that people would frequently pass
by. These are quite nice, because they happen to pick up wildlife too;
that is their purpose primarily by design. And so I get wonderful
footage of a variety of animals, most frequently Moose, Bear, Coyote and
Lynx. Once I even got a shot of what appeared to be a wolverine. While
these critters are what I’m most happy to see in the trail cameras, and
they use paths even more frequently than the people do, I do find a lot
of human photos of people who either don’t have permission to be there,
do have permission (I quickly pass by these when reviewing), and people
who are entirely unknown to me.</p>
<p><img class="ui huge center image transition visible"   src="trail-camera-moose.jpg" /><br /></p>
<p><strong><em>One of Many Moose Photos, Near My RV.</em></strong></p>
<p>Not long after buying the property, I had to get insurance just to
cover liabilities, for all these people crossing through. If someone
were to get injured, it couldn’t be completely on me, to pay any
damages, even though they are clearly trespassers. This is one major
reason why my neighbor and I require folks to sign an access agreement,
with waiver and promise to not misuse the property, in order to get
through. This agreement is entirely like a typical waiver someone might
sign for access to other parks. It’s probably less than what might
required to enter an amusement park or other destination with risks,
that they would certainly sign for readily and quickly. But instead,
many are worried about revocation, and have ulterior motives, about
gaining access for the public, for other probably selfish reasons that
have not yet been disclosed and will be disclosed in court.</p>
<p>So at first, I had a few standard trespassing signs, and couple
rather large “eyeball” signs, at the front and rear entrances. Later,
out of concern for ladies who apparently need endless signs, I purchased
many smaller ones, and scattered them at areas of interest across other
parts of the property that are possible to traverse without too much
difficulty. Many were also eyeball signs, and others were signs
indicating I would actively work with the police if they did not exit
the property. Those who had agreements, and were kind and considerate,
knew they could pass by without issue. In fact, anyone could, since I
did not cause anyone any issues and did not want altercations, although
that did happen on one occasion with three strange guys, that I’ll later
describe.</p>
<p>Despite having to put in the effort to create these signs, it was a
good time in a number of ways. I am in technology, and had some
experience designing websites and ads, and this gave me a chance to play
with creative software again. Also, the signs I received were highly
reflective, and quite well done, and I felt accomplished just making
them. Unfortunately neighbors would destroy, deface, and/or remove them,
but most were left intact, and I enjoy seeing them as I hike around. I
was worried, that being quite obvious and reflective, they would be
bothersome, taking away from the natural experience, but it hasn’t
turned out that way at all. I hardly notice them, and when I do, I’m
glad to see them.</p>
<p>While out and about in town I do believe I’ve heard references to the
signs on more than one occasion. One time, while out to dinner, I
believe I heard a loud “Why would you choose an eyeball?” or something
similar. I’m sure some were not happy with the signage, but it is much
less imposing and threatening, than other signs around town, that
threaten to kill anyone who walks onto their property, and about having
plenty of ammo and guns to get it done!</p>
<p>Since I bought the property, I’ve been astonished at some ill will,
and poor treatment I’ve received. It only escalated from the beginning,
but from the very start, people were often hostile, made veiled threats,
or were thoroughly disingenuous when hearing there was a new buyer in
the neighborhood.</p>
<p>I suspect there was some jealousy, and some anger about having some
new threat, or person to deal with, about being able to pass through, or
use the land. Since it was vacant before, people could enjoy themselves
in various ways without anyone paying much attention, but now that there
was a serious owner, it appeared there could be development, and that
there were changes in a location that was hitherto mostly untouched,
like the park they were supposedly walking to. The reality was that the
vacant parcels were the park too, and they really didn’t make it all the
way to their supposed destinations.</p>
<p>So not long after buying, I made sure to protect my investment,
comply with insurance, and otherwise make it known to others and that
the property was in fact mine. Without doing that, many who walked
through would ask who I was, driving along, as if I weren’t the owner,
and that they had a greater claim than I did to be there.</p>
<p>Between my signs and cameras, I wanted to make it clear that I could
see folks, and they came in very handy, for presenting evidence to the
police, and should continue to be helpful in dealing with the legal
complaints I’m now facing.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-12.-trespassing-and-safety">Chapter 12. Trespassing and
Safety</h2>
<p>As time went on, and the issues with neighbors began to increase in
severity, I became more and more concerned with safety. It didn’t take
long before I was able to confirm some serious limitations with RV and
Tiny House living when it comes to safety.</p>
<p>A factor that hardly goes noticed, or is ever pointed out, on
television shows about dreams of living in tiny houses, and of tiny
housese with various designs for making life easier, is the fact that in
tiny house, people know exatly where you are at all times.</p>
<p>This is not something we normally think about if we are living in a
normal home, that might at least several rooms, or more than one
level.</p>
<p>While on the road, this was something that I did think about, and
wondered if it would matter. In an RV, it is very clearly where the
bedroom is. This means, at night, if I’m in the RV, peopel not only know
where I am within a less than 300 square foot space, they know most
likely I’m in a box that is little more than a cage, without even the
normal ceiling space, and about 50 square feetor less.</p>
<p>People already worry about home break ins, even if not living in this
type of space. As a kid, when I thought about home break-ins, or fires,
or tornados, or any other event that would scare me, I would imagine
various plans for how I would escape. I would go through this window, or
I would go out this door, to this other room to this other window, and
get outside, with the perpetrator, or the fire, in another location of
the house. But where do you go when there is only one door? Where do you
go, if an attack is directly on your bedroom, when you’re sleeping?</p>
<p>While it might seem that this is something that is not really worth
thinking about, it does actually matter. When I was finally living in
the RV, temporarily in RV parks, and out on my property, mostly in the
middle of nowhere, I did end up having passers by who I did not know. On
my land, roughly one mile from any neighbor (except one who was somewhat
closer), I would have neighbors walk right up beside my RV with myself
inside.</p>
<p>Similarly, I’m also living in a location with Bears. I would wonder
to myself, if the flimsy RV door could ever be ripped off, and if a bear
would ever come through it, or another window. If so, how would I
escape? While this might not seem like something worth worrying about
(and over time, I became much less concerned about the risks posed by
bears), I did awake on more than one occasion, once at 4 a.m., to a bear
scouring the back of my truck. Once, in dark conditions, I was awoken to
a bear that was in the bed of my truck, less than 8 feet away from me! I
looked out the window, which was part of a wall that was only inches
thick, to see a brown bear, aggressively tearing through a tarp, trying
to find some trash that happened to be there. While I try to be very
careful about such things, occassionally, here and there, oversights and
negligences of the sort do occur. And on this occasion, I was very sorry
to see that a bear had actually appeared where I was hoping it would
not. And again, living in a small space, there are not many places to
go, and I found myself in the darkness, holding my shotgun ready to
shoot the thing if it tried to come into the RV after tearing through
the truck. And while I have not experienced this sort of thing
frequently, it only takes one occurrence to be killed by a stranger,
breaking into your home, and I’ve heard stories about bears breaking
into peoples garages, and even nesting in their homes (in pilesof
possessions that they’ll collect from inside your house), so bears will
try to enter, and obviously murders do in fact take place in homes after
breaking and entering events.</p>
<p>Taking it just a little further: if you were a drug addict and you
were desperate, and you were going to break into a nice tiny house, or
RV, to get possessions from someone who was of high repute, or known to
have money (because who wants to live in a tiny house or RV, and not at
the same time, have some repute and high quality lifestyle and living
conditions?), where would you break in? You would only have one or two
places to enter. You would enter through the main door, or a secondary
door if you had one, or else a large window.</p>
<p>Conversely, I’ve never found myself living in a large house. Living
in a large home might create some alternative fears, so it could be,
that fears associated with living under one set of conditions, are
simply replaced with fears assocaiated with living in another. For
example, in a large house, how do you know if someone isn’t hiding in a
particular location? Or, if someone breaks in, how do you know if they
are still in there or not? In a smaller home, you know right away if
anyone is still inside. It’s pretty easy to look in your single room and
say “Nobody’s here.” So there are still benefits, even if there are
drawbacks about fears living in a smaller house.</p>
<p>Although I do admit, I wonder, here and there: What if someone just
sets fire underneath my bedroom, or what if someone justdecides to shoot
through the side or back of my RV? What if someone decides to gas me out
of it.</p>
<p>And what is totally astonishing, is that I <em>do</em>, in fact, deal
with break ins to my RV. I have come home to see my possessions moved,
or things stolen. I’ve had vandalism. I’ve entered my RV, and founds
things different. I was tipped off, by my neighbor, when I moved the RV
there, that “Teens might want to enter it to have a plact to have sex”
(or some similar comment). I found that a bit odd, but the reality is, I
do experience break-ins. And with the number of passers by, I have no
idea who is doing it, or when, and what they’ll do when I’m inside of
it.</p>
<p>So even though I have an RV in a beautiful location, and a wonderful
property with amazing scenery, I’ve experienced some pretty severe
stress, about what happens to my home when I’m gone, or whether or not
I’ll ever be harmed by someone passing right by my window, or right
underneath my bedroom, while I’m there sleeping at night.</p>
<p><a name="elected-into-the-community-council"></a></p>
<h2 id="chapter-13.-elected-into-community-council">Chapter 13. Elected
into Community Council</h2>
<p>Not long after buying my property, I discovered that a large number
of those wanting to take my drieway for public use, and many
trespassers, made up the leadership or at least influential portion of
my community council. My neighbor, Frank, who was already a member out
of necessity, suggested that I come along. So in 2017, I started to
visit mostly regularly on a month to month basis. It was a very
interesting experince and was my introduction into local politics, and
in politics in Alaska.</p>
<p>Meetings immediately reminded me of church. They were held in the
local middle school’s library, at a section that had two rows of maybe 8
long rectangular tables, that had 4 seats each. There was an area where
presentations could be given, and folks could awkwardly turn to watch
the front from various angles in the room. Overflow participation was
held towards the back, near the enterance of the library, where some
would find additional seats or simply stand. This is where some of the
more anxious or introverted folks would hang out, and periodically jump
in as required. Guest speakers, police officers, fire fighters, and
local politicians would also frequently join in at these locations,
standing, waiting foropportunties to share, or otherwise join in.</p>
<p>The crowd was definitely older. The age group appeared to be skewed
towards folks in their mid fifties, who were mostly well-to-do
landowners or property holders in South Anchorage, which is an area
where some more affluent people live; that being said, there wasn’t any
appearance of great wealth, although some in the room may simply project
more humble or at least, lest ostentatious appearances. Most did not
appear to be professionals, altough many were. Dress was casual or
comfortable after-work attire. When the schools were closed, meetings
were held at a local church, which certainly made it feel more
church-like, although demeanors and manners of interacting also, to my
mind, recalled a “church house gathering” type of organization,
reminiscent of earlier America. Gatherings were generally at the
schoolhouses or at churches, and this is still the casein remote alaskan
villages, and I most would recognize thta this is a fair comparison.</p>
<p>Sign-in sheets were in pencil and paper, and there was a resistance
to having any remote attendance or any kind of teleconference. During
several meetings, the option for remote attendance and voting were
raised, and supported by travellerslike myself, and a pilot in
attendance, and others who were more familiar with technology. I recall
emphasizing how I worked entirely remotely and conducted important
business meetings routinely with no issue through a wide array of
teleconferencing tools, like Zoom and Skype, and there was a very strong
resistance, particularly from those, unfortunately, wanted access to my
property. They wanted to keep it a very intimate gathering place, were
community really was church like. I found their perspective to be not
that unexpected, but still quite luddite. Especially, since later,
during the coronavirus pandemic, I began to see links from the group,
ready, seemingly excited and willing, to do everything over video, and
I’m certain, all are quite aware that it is not as infeasible as they
expected.</p>
<p>I found myself among a group of between 20 and 25 people in regular
attendance, although when things got interesting and more convroversial,
we had nearly one hundred participants, and even discussed possible
changes of venue for if there were more people. There was a clique of
about 10 or fewer people in regular attendance who made up the normal
board. These members routinely discussed property rights, and were very
interested in being involved in the municipal approval of permits, even
though this was not in their specialty. They were and are very concerned
about the uses of property, about who owns what, who is doing
what-with-what. A few key members of this clique were more knowledgeable
or invovled in anything around property planning, and one person in
particular, had a career around land-use, named Nancy Pease. Nancy Pease
has an impressive resume, and is a hall of fame Alaskan runner, who
leads most efforts two write to the municipality on property rights
related issues, and whenever she creates a motion to write a letter,
most quickly and almost involuntarily vote on her behalf.</p>
<p>This is where my interest in the community council was heightened. It
seemed clear to me that there was one group in control, they were averse
to property rights in a number of ways I did not like, mostly in the
meddlesome quality of it, and the introverted nature of taking action
without notifying homeowners and property owners (they would contest
development projects without reaching out to those involved in those
projects, and would make excuses about it). Worst of all, these people
were the same folks who were forming a non-profit organization to take
my driveway for public use, and seeing the quickness that certain other
neighbors would vote, without much thought at all, in favor of key
member motions, was shocking. I came to view the RCCC (Rabbit Creek
Community Council), as a special interest group, that would try to force
through actions without much concern about what the larger public might
want or need, and they did it seemingly compulsively. On one occasion, a
motion was put to write a letter to the municipality, that I opposed,
and after putting it through vote, when it was questioned what the
letter would be about, all those who voted couldn’t remember what it was
they voted for.</p>
<p>As a homesteader of the modern variety, in retrospect, I should have
realized, I would have had to go down this unfortunate path, of being
involved in the community, and of being involved with numerous other
organizations and stakeholders, in ways that would on conflict with the
way things were done previously. At this time, I was mostly shocked that
I had to deal with politicians and notable figures who were mostly stuck
in an old church-person’s process, with luddite tendencies, and very
little mental flexibility.</p>
<p>It was pretty obvious from the start, I think, that I did not fit in
very cleanly. Typically I would wear a baseball cap, jeans with no belt,
that would sometimes sag, and a tight fitting athletic t-shirt, even on
cold days, sometimes covered in a hoodie), that would show my tatoo and
muscles. It definitely created some odd attention, since I would get
stares, which were usually out of interest, out of being something new
and different, but others would look with some disgust. Later on, it
would be mostly disgust, until a point came, where people would actively
attempt to shame and humiliate me, although I did not allow that to
impatct me too adversely. I had no intention of simply changing my
entire mode of life, built from years traveling, and my personal
interests, style, and preferred appearance, which was certainly fit and
attractive, but quite different from the drab and mundane appearances of
older Alaskans who didn’t care that much about appearance, in a more
rural/country setting. Interestingly enough, there was a group of
newcoming younger people in Anchorage who did seem to dress more like
myself, particularly those who frequented gyms and other establishments
that certainly were not normal for the older-fashioned homesteaders.
After all, during westward expansion, there were no gyms, and certainly,
there were no technologist who lived at one time in Miami Beach, coming
to Alaska to live like they did, but in a more modern mode.</p>
<p><a name="large-earthquakes-and-remote-work"></a></p>
<h2 id="chapter-14.-large-earthquakes-and-remote-work">Chapter 14. Large
Earthquakes and Remote Work</h2>
<p>One morning, while sleeping in my RV, just before arising for work, I
was awoken suddenly to some violent shaking. In a mostly bewildered,
foggy and slumberous state, I realized theentire front end of the RV,
including the tiny sleeping quarters that normally sits above the truck
bed, was bouncing up and down off the ground. It felt as if I were on
the road and had encountered a rough and wavy part of the road, except
instead of driving, I was sleeping. Despite such a strange way to be
woken up, this did not last for a very longtime, and, characteristically
I went straight back to sleep, since I’m a very sound sleeper, and it
takesquite a lot to get me finally wake up in the morning. So back to
sleep I went, as if nothing important had happened.</p>
<p>Not long after, however, I awoken again to rumbling, and before the
rumbling, I could hear sounds deep within the earth, first at a
distance, then approaching, before suddenly the RV was hit with a jolt;
in a way that is reminiscent of lightening and thunder. This happened
more than once. The sound was of a sort that I never experienced before,
and may never experience again. It sounded like deep vibration similar
to what is experienced the movies, with a very high quality surround
sound system. Those deep bass vibrations that exaggerate the drama of
the arrival of an alien ship, or an experience ofsuspense, in some movie
trailers.</p>
<p>After this happened maybe two times, I finally decided to get out of
bed. When I went into the living area of the RV I saw that most of my
possessions that were on tables were on the ground, and it was at that
point that I realized I experienced an earthquake. I had no idea, at
that time, what the severity might have been. I’ve been through other
earthquakes, such as the one that hit the Washington D.C. area in the
early 2010s. I was also through a large number of small tremors while
still in Alaska, but this was the very first time my possessions were
shaking off of tables and other surfaces onto the ground, and so I
thought it might at least be as serious as the one I experienced in DC,
which was just over magitude 5.</p>
<p>I was a little shocked at this experience, but still went ahead and
gathered mythings, to make a trip into town to get some work done. I
then got in my truck, and began to make my way down my long driveway,
which makes for quite a trip in itself, just getting to my gate, so I
recall along the way having 5 minutes trying to get tuned into the radio
to listen to music for my morning drive, instead finding nothing but
emergency programming, keeping everyone aware of the emergency situation
that existed. People were calling in, giving their statuses, letting
people know which parts of town were safe and unsafe. It was at thistime
that I realized I had experienced a serious sitaution, and when I got to
the gate, where I had a solid internet connection through my cell phone,
I discovered that we had experienceda 7.1 magnitude earthquake, and
while I was safe up in the mountains in an RV, disconnected from the
ground, mostly designed to bounce around on roadways with forces that
probably greatly exceed those that would be produced by earthquakes,
everyone else in Anchorage was either in a solid home with a foundation,
or in solid buildings that may have felt like they would collapse. When
I experienced my 5.4 earthquake, I was in Bethesda, Maryland, working at
that time as a remote employee, in the business center in the lobby.
When that happened, I recall hearing something that sounded like
construction equipment suddenly started to begin work, and the building
that was definitely not constructed for surviving earthquakes, since on
the east coast where earthquakes did not normally happen, felt like it
was swaying and made worried that it could collapse upon me. Given that
this earthquake was far more powerful, I could only imagine at how
people at work already must have felt.</p>
<p>That day, I ended up working anyway, at the only coffeehouse I could
find that was open, which happen to be called, of all things,
“Aftershock Espresso”. While most in town were reflecting on what had
happened, I, as a remote employee, was able to get my normal days worth
of work done, for my client, which was Petco at the time, who had their
headquarters in San Diego, California. It was a normal work day for
them, but was quite a strange day for me. One drawback of remote work
though, is that normal occurrances that allow people in the office to
take the day off, do not necessarily apply. On this occasion, and on the
prior occasion in DC, I was still expected to get my work done, since I
had no genuine excuse for not being able to work.</p>
<p>Later in the day, I decided to go out to a restaruant, despite the
situation, and sat down to find the entire room quiet, seemingly in
shock at what had happened. People were not boisterous, or enjoying
themselves. It was a mostly sombre experience, with most people in their
heads, reflecting on what had happened. This made it quite clear to me
that people were genuinely shaken by the event, despite the fact that
many were from the area, and most were not nearly old enough to
experiencethe ~9.0 magnitude earthquake, from 1964, that caused
landslides and massive tsunamis. But most were aware that such
earthquakes were possible, and that Anchorage is situated in a way that
everyone in the main portion of the city were at risk of true
catastrophe if an earthquake of such a size were ever to happen again.
Nevertheless I still could not quite comprehend just how scary the
situation was, given the fact taht I was mostly in a protected
environmet in my mobile home.</p>
<p>At this time, it became obvious to me, that I was extremely well
situated on my property in case of earthquake or other similar disaster,
unless of course, a landslide were triggered above me; but that doesn’t
seem realistic or likely. Instead, I’m in a location that isover 1,000
feet above sea level, which is quite far above any tsunami that could
hit. And again, with a mobile structure, there is virtually no risk of
having a home collapse. Working remotely.</p>
<h3 id="remote-work">Remote Work</h3>
<p>Not everyone can work remotely and I consider myself extremely
fortunate for having a career that would allow me to be just about
anyplace that has a solid internet connection, to get my work done. How
else could I have a story about waking up in an RV in Alaska to an
earthquake, only to be able to have a somewhat normal workday, and a
normal paycheck, by finding one of the few stable and free internet
connections available in town?</p>
<p>Remote work is something that seems like something one can be envious
about, and there are definitely benefits, but there are many pitfalls as
well. Especially when trying to work off grid. One thing of interest,
for example, is that I had to leave my RV. Why couldn’t I just wake up,
and start work then and there? That is possible, but it requires more
planning than expected, depending on the situation.</p>
<p>My property is still fairly close to a normal neighborhood, but</p>
<ul>
<li>Has no electricity run to it.</li>
<li>Has no gas run to it.</li>
<li>Has no cellular signal from the provider I committed to, which was
GCI, a local cell carrier.</li>
<li>Had no cable television or internet service provider access.</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to get any of the usual utilities, or internet, I would have
to request them to create utility connections at no less than 1/3 mile
from one location, which is unlikely, and nearly a mile and a half in
the other direction, along my driveway. The costs to achieve this are
incredibly high. I estimated nearly one hundred thousand dollars for
electricity alone. So clearly, this was infeasible, and truly, I was in
an off grid living situations.</p>
<p>In order to have a solid internet connection for remote work,
directly from my home location, I had a few options, and I ended up
testing them all.</p>
<ul>
<li>Get an additional cell service provider.</li>
<li>Get a satellite internet hookup.</li>
<li>Drive to the end of the driveway to get cell service intermittently,
for customer calls.</li>
<li>Drive to coffee houses daily, or other free locations offering solid
internet connections.</li>
<li>Pay for a stable office environment.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyone who is considering remote work in a tiny house, in a location
off grid should really consider the reality that one will still need a
solid office location to work, despite having various ways to connect to
the internet. Even though cell service seems reliable, there are days
where meeting clarity is not good, and there can even be crossovers into
other conversations, and even moments where eavesdropping seemed like it
was happening. Other times, connections are not solid, or are just too
glitchy for situations calling for professionalism, even when one might
not expect the need—to give an example, my online school classes
suddenly shifted to require a presence on the webcam for each and every
class for multiple house. Any glitch would create stress, and bandwidth
and data limits became a concern. If one cell phone didn’t work, I would
either have to have another, or an alternative connection. Or,
alternatively, I could drive to a location where a connection was
better, but even this did not work on occasion. Nearly everytime I found
a way to make it work, but it was something that caused unnecessary
stress, especially given all of the other issues with living off
grid.</p>
<p>Trying to have a realisitic option for work, I opted to pay for
satellite internet services. I found a good deal at a 12 gbs bandwidth,
and I was and am still very happy with it. But there are outages.
Outages can be completely inappropriate for work. Furthermore, power is
required. So I had to have the generator running at all times while
using it, and if weather became inclement, I could lose my connection
entirely. There were times that I would look at the router and wonder
“Why me, why now?”, and have poor cellular connection at the same time.
So again, even with Satellite, there is not an adequate level of
redundancy created, and one still ends up stressign about having a good
and solid connection, that would exist at a normal workplace.</p>
<p>Since my job is fairly elevated, it requires and especially high
level of professionalism. Often I’m leading calls, or am asked to join
in at key moments, when business decisions are going to be made. If I
don’t have a solid internet connection, there are going to be problems,
and even with a solid connection, I get questioned about the quality of
my many microphones, which themselves cause stress. Between that issue,
and itnernet connectivity, I have to say, while living remotely and off
grid is nice, it is not really a realistic scenario to live in complete
comfort while working off grid, because there is no way at all to have a
stable connection. To have a stable connection, power must be assured
(I’vehad generator failures, and have run out of fuel), and so on.</p>
<p>As this was occuring, I thought it might be useful to have an office.
Fortunately, there are really good coworking spaces that allow access at
a very low cost, on a restricted basis. For example, you can go to a
location providing what appears to be a normal corporate work
environment, and get solid internet access, and other services, at a
fraction of the cost, for using several days a month or whole months. I
opted initially to have several days a month at two different locations,
in order to keep costs down and simplly have more options. After all, I
could still work in coffee houses, and it seemed reasonable enough to
distribute my work to a variety of locations, have plenty of options, to
make myself feel confident that I would always have a way to handle
interruptions at any particular location.</p>
<p>However, what actually happens in such a scenario is this. You’re
working at a coffee house, and you have a meeting scheduled in an hour.
Now, for myself, client calls area always confidential. I would have to
be in a very quiet and mostly empty coffehouse to be able to have a
truly successful business call, at least here in Anchorage, where people
aren’t normally doing that, versus, say, in a coffeehouse in Seattle,
where a large number of people may be having private meetings at the
same time, and there is a greater understanding about minding one’s
business when someone is conducting a phone call. This has been relaxed
due to the Coronavirus pandemic, but in normal conditions, it is not an
easy thing to do, to have remote meetings in coffee houses. So when the
calendar indicates that it is time for a meeting, suddenly you think
“Where do I go now?”, and while it is nice to have options, those
options soon lead to indecision. Do I have enough hours at this office,
or that office, or do I really want to see these people, or those people
again, at this or that other location? Especially, as time goes on.
After a year of doing this, almost every location becomes an annoying
place to work, and one finds oneself simply wanting solitude or a normal
work environment, where everything is stable, well taken care of, and
provides everything that professionalism requires. And, you only need to
be at one place, drive to one location, and so on.</p>
<p>I’ve done much more than this to try to keep things cheap and
flexible. I’ve rented hotel rooms on whim to have a quiet location. I
can really say I’ve almost tried everything at this point, and the only
thing that’s brought me back to some normalcy was renting an office that
was just for myself (which still turned out weird, because it was in a
coworking environment where gradually people become too interested in
what you’re doing and try to pry or compete with you and what you’re
doing), and rented an apartment with a stable connection. The best
option, by far, has beento simply have a stable connection at a rented
apartment. And under those circumstances, one has to wonder “Why do I
have a tiny house off grid, and an apartment also.” I’m still in this
predicament, as I try to plan my construction for my more permanent home
on my land. In the meantime, I have to pay for an apartment to have a
more solid work environment, with duplicates costs.</p>
<p>Workign remote is amazing. Even if I have to have an office, I can
still go where I want to temporarily. I can work from any city I want. I
can and do travel internationally while working, and can accept any
client at any location. I’ve had clients, and colleagues all across the
globe. But what I can say for certain, at this point in time, which I
hope helps someone considering working off grid, that the need for a
stble internet connection in a remote location cannot be overcome with
comfort, even with redundancies, unless one can work long periods of
time without needing any external contact with a customer, for meetings,
or for large downloads (and uploads!), and other uses of bandwidth.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-15.-unexpected-divorce">Chapter 15. Unexpected
Divorce</h2>
<p>Another issue that can result as a consequence of moving into a tiny
house lifestyle is pressure on relationships.</p>
<p>I was with my wife for nearly 20 years, since we became a couple in
our senior year in High School. We even went to the same middle
school.</p>
<p>After all that time, we mostly lived in small environments happily.
Almost every living space we shared was less than 600 square feet,
although we lived in a two bedroom condo together for several years as
well. When we decided to shift to live a more frugal lifestyle, we also
lived in much smaller efficiency and studio apartments, and had no
trouble living that way either. Although we did get our needs for space
by spending large amounts of time outside our house. We even refered to
our house as a “house cave” to indicate that it was not an optimal place
to spend too much of our time.</p>
<p>However, there are important differences between living in small
apartments andliving in an RV or tiny home that creates more
pressure.</p>
<p>Firstly, if you choose to have a tiny home in a location that allows
it, there is a good chance it’s in a rural setting, where there are no
neighborhood rules prohibiting it. Apartments are more likely to be more
urban, and have closer proximity to restaurants, gyms, grocery stores,
and other places that allow for some escape from one another. In a tiny
house, or RV, one is more likely to feel “trapped” with no means of
escape. Kim and I also shared a vehicle, to keep costs down, and this
made conditions worse, because not only were we confined to a small
living space, we had to commute together. Whenever we were together, it
seemed we were always in a vehicle or the RV.</p>
<p>Our divorce was not due to the pressures of living in an RV or Tiny
House, although living in more stressful conditions certainly lead on
occasion to more conflict. Instead, we simply were in a declining
relationship anyway, that became toxic, and we simply needed to
separate.</p>
<p><a name="foraging"></a></p>
<h2 id="chapter-16.-foraging">Chapter 16. Foraging</h2>
<p><img class="ui huge center image transition visible"   src="foraging-edible-young-fiddlehead-fern.jpg" /><br /></p>
<p><em>Young, unfurled and edible fiddlehead fern. From near one of my
seasonal streams.</em></p>
<p>Many have asked me “How can you be Vegan in Alaska?”. Of course,
places in the far north approaching the Arctic do not bring to mind
agriculture, and fields of varieties of vegetables. Instead, we think of
fishing for salmon, hunting, trapping, cold, ice, darkness, and maybe
even whale or seal hunting expeditions. After hearing so many people ask
it, and recalling my original reasons for wanting to visit (to see the
outdoors, and experience some survivalism), I can’t fault anyone for
wondering. But the truth is there is so much to do besides these
activities, and contrary to all expectations, Alaska does produce large
quantities of produce, although mostly the hearty fall and winter crops,
which can grow to massive sizes because of prolonged daylight in the
summer time. There are also large varieties of berries and other
products which are more commonly found here than elsewhere, and some
native plant species which can be eaten.</p>
<p>Part of my interest in my land is to forage for food, although since
I’ve been pre-occupied with so many other activities, I haven’t been
able to fully take advantage of this yet. For many plants there is a
very short window for collection too, so foraging is not exactly
something that can be done most of the year either, except for one
plant: rosehips. I walk around my property snacking on the infinite
number of rosehips around. They taste like small tart apples. These are
commonly dried and used for tea, and can be found in stores across the
untied states. But I have never seen them fresh until I bought this
property, and they are everywhere. I hear they’re a good source of
vitamin C. While I’m out I eat far more than I should, and could easily
collect gallons of them for many months of the year. Even after first
snow, I’ve seen them popping out through, looking just fine and ready to
taste.</p>
<p>You can also eat small ferns, and other plants while they are still
very young, and tender, before they change character and become largely
inedible. In this respect they remind me of bamboo shoots, that I used
to see in Maryland, sprouting up through the soil, ready to be eaten for
a very short time, much like white asparagus, and asparagus in general,
before it becomes a tiny tree. My family grew asparagus in our garden
when I was a kid, and I’m happy to have the chance to try to find
anything and everything I can eat off my lot, at whatever stage of
development the plant allows for it. I’ve even been chomping on
dandelions, which are quite good, even though most think of them as
worthless weeds. They are not native to Alaska, but nevertheless, are
plentiful, and easily passed up, without good reason, for greens that
must be purchased at the grocery store instead (not that one would want
to stop shopping at the grocery store).</p>
<p><img class="ui huge center image transition visible"   src="dandelions-to-munch.jpg" /><br /></p>
<p><img class="ui huge center image transition visible"   src="dandelions-to-munch-2.jpg" /><br /></p>
<p><em>Everyone’s favorite weed: the Dandelion. Plentiful and yummy. And
somewhat odd to eat.</em></p>
<p>One cannot be a Vegan in Alaska without depending on an outside
source of nutrition, however. I would argue that one cannot be a happy
Alaskan without eating food that comes from someplace else though, and
the grocery system here is surprisingly high quality. I think grocery
stores are significantly better than most I’ve grown up with and have
had access to almost <em>anyplace</em> I’ve lived. Variety is good,
prices are good, and quality is pretty high almost all year round.
Produce <em>especially</em>. But it depends on where you live. In
Anchorage, and the vicinity, there are too many grocery stores of high
quality to count. Out in the Alaskan villages, that are found scattered
across the state, much fewer options exist, and prices are extremely
high. I once advertised for a company here in Alaska, when I first moved
here in 2009, called “Alaska Bush Shoppers.” At that time, I recall that
bush shopping through Sams Club and this company, and others, was more
common seemingly than it is today, although I have not stayed apprised
in changes. I think it is just easier to order online most likely. But
at that time, people have the postal service air deliver and even air
drop food, which came from a catalog that did not appear to be anything
nearly as healthy as what existed in the grocery stores. People were
willing to pay 5 dollars for a snickers bar, or some value near that
amount, simply to have that taste they craved from not having access to
the normal grocery store. Kim also had a job for a time in the early
childhood education system (head start), and she would visit these tiny
villages. She said the grocery stores were really expensive–incredibly
so, and did not have a very large variety of options. This makes sense,
because in many of these locations, there was very little there but an
airstrip, some small number of stores, and a school house, which took on
a more central role as a place to gather than elsewhere. She would even
sleep in the schoolhouse, since there were no other accommodations.
People who live in these areas, take sustainable living seriously, and
get much of their diet from elsewhere. From hunting, fishing, or
lifestyle that is more in keeping with what you would expect from
indigenous peoples of the area.</p>
<p>While at one point I was fascinated by the idea of living a
survivalist lifestyle, or a life off the land, I would only want to
attempt that in a climate that could completely support it with the
requisite legumes, seeds, nuts, and any other food that I could largely
survive on, but in adequate variety to keep me from getting bored. But
that is a daunting task, to be a farmer of so many different types of
foods, wherever you happen to live. And I really prefer to have my home
base in Alaska. That means I need to be able to get along with what
exists in the store, and in that way, I’m not different from anyone else
living in any city across the United States and Canada, and as I was
saying, in many ways I’m <em>better off</em> for having land I could
farm, forage, and grocery stores of high quality; even though that might
come as a surprise to some readers that that would be the case. I can’t
claim these stores would impress everyone from everywhere, but compared
to Maryland, Virginia and Miami Beach, these stores really are pretty
good. Produce can be better quality and cheaper. Some foods like Chips,
processed vegan foods, and Cereals seem far more expensive though,
presumably because of shipping costs associated with high volume boxes
at low weight.</p>
<p>10 years ago, being vegan here was more difficult in the sense that
restaurants did not really serve vegan options, that were not the same
options everyone else at that happened to be vegan (bread sticks, french
fries, etc…), although I can remember I could get the basic veggie
sandwich at Subway, soy drinks at Starbucks, and veggie burritos at
Qdoba. Today, however, there is a much greater variety of vegetarian and
vegan options, and some places make special efforts to cater to these
groups. I have innumerable options, and almost everyone has the more
current veggie burger options, the newer vegetarian meats (“Impossible”
and “Beyond Meat” burgers). One change was that every coffee place I
visit seems to have any variant of veggie milk you could want. Coconut
milk, almond milk, etc… in addition to the standard soy option. There is
no difficulty whatsoever being Vegan here, and when I return back to
Maryland to visit family, I feel as though I have the same or even fewer
options.</p>
<p>Sit-in restaurants also have many more options than before, and in
Anchorage I can find plenty of places to eat, such that I don’t get
bored, or run out of new and different options. Even when leaving the
area, there seem to be plenty of options. I believe this is largely due
to the impact of the tourism industry, as Veganism has become so
widespread that many people visiting Alaska, presumably, put pressure to
offer these options to ensure that they are comfortable. Hospitality is
good. I always felt like Alaska had superior waiters and hostesses, in
comparison with almost every other place I visited. More recently I’ve
had some difficulties, but that was only after living in the state for a
very long time as a resident. Prior to that I only noticed that staff
was really high quality at almost every restaurant I would go to.</p>
<p>More recently, I even discovered there is a Vegan Society of Alaska
here, near Palmer, AK, close to where I was living in my RV in the
winter, and near where I’m now living. I joined and there is a fairly
large membership, with the last meeting hosting around 20-30 for a vegan
potluck. I was invited by someone I ran into at a grocery store,
browsing for veggie products that were on sale. I felt a little
ridiculous that I did not seek out such a group sooner, but it is clear
that groups of people do exist in and around Anchorage who characterize
themselves as vegetarian or vegan.</p>
<p>People seem accepting of veganism too. A decade ago, I can remember
debating about it, and maybe I could find people here who are still not
exposed sufficiently to understand that it is a viable way of life.
Nevertheless, I can tell there have been changes. I still don’t feel
compelled to tell anyone about my lifestyle choice, but I also feel that
it would be less of a cause for ostracism or stigma than before. An
upcoming younger generation seems to be much more tolerant of differing
lifestyles, at least from what I can tell, not being incredibly steeped
in the community, for a number of reasons relating to business, my
lawsuit, and my divorce, which considerably changed how I approached
relationships with others.</p>
<p>“Do you fish?” and “Do you hunt?” are common questions that come up.
My answers usually are “I used to fish,” and “My family hunts, but my
mother kept me from getting involved in guns as a kid, so I mostly hike
and enjoy nature.</p>
<p>I’ve been vegetarian since Thanksgiving 2000, and vegan since January
2001. So it’s been nearly 20 years. I could easily be criticized for not
being more open with my lifestyle, but with my property situation, I
find that people are so nosy an gossipy, I’d prefer to not share every
detail about so others can converse about how non-Alaskan they think I
am. This has nothing to do with receptiveness to the diet though, and
more to do with social issues faced regarding the property, and the fact
that so many neighbors who are involved in the situation are insistent
on knowing information about me, just because I moved in, including who
I am, what my intentions are being in Alaska, how I will develop my
land, and many other minute details. And all the while, I’m wondering
why I don’t know anything about them at all. As part of my lawsuit, I
was even deposed, which meant I had to answer questions with a lawyer
who was probing me about personal details. With these people, in this
situation, then, I’m very much adverse to giving personal details at
this point. I’m very open, and they take advantage of that. Some have
even scoured my social media profiles to mock me in public about what
they found. So the last thing I want to do is talk to people about my
choice of lifestyle, and I certainly don’t spend my time trying to
proselytize or convert anyone.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there is the ongoing complaint about Vegans that we hear
endlessly that we self-announce. Some may do that, and I may have done
that while I was especially interested, when I first started. But the
reality is, people are perceptive when they notice differences. At
dinner, they’ll ask. When they ask, it becomes a longish conversation.
It’s one I’ve had so many times at this point, I usually take a pass,
even when asked in a dinner scenario, or give a polite response and
indicate it might be better to share more at another time.</p>
<p>In summary, however, I have to say, it’s been really easy these days
to be vegan here and on the road. I also think it is highly likely that
writing about this topic will soon become unnecessary. Maybe ten years
from now, it will be so mundane and mainstream, that it will be a truism
that people can live in these areas easily, in a tiny house environment,
growing and even foraging on property, with supplements coming from
grocery stores, and plenty of other options to choose from.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-17.-trespassing-worsens">Chapter 17. Trespassing
Worsens</h2>
<p>One day, while spending time in my RV on my driveway, trying my best
to enjoy my new solitude, on my property, that was supposed to be quiet
and remote, I had some unwanted visitors pass through.</p>
<p>My RV is off grid, with no electricity, no plumbing, and at the time,
there were no network services. It is just over 1 mile away from a
somewhat sparsely inhabited neighborhood with a normal road.</p>
<p><img class="ui huge center image transition visible"   src="the-rv-as-it-currently-sits-as-a-base-station.jpg" /></p>
<p><em>(View of the McHugh Peak, in Chugach State Park, just opposite
the water)</em></p>
<p>While Anchorage was accessible, it is true wilderness where I was
staying. A neighbor said I was “kinda crazy for staying out there.”
There are bears, moose, and lynx, and many other wild animals. It is
very close to Chugach State park, a massive park of National Park
quality, full of dangerous animals, in their natural habitat.</p>
<p>A driveway that connects a nearby neighborhood roadway system
starting at my neighbor’s gate, extends just over a mile through my
property, most of the way to the park boundary of the park. No one lives
along the shared driveway. Myself and my neighbors own vacant parcels of
land, that we intend to build on, although we were not yet able to begin
construction. I was the only one spending significant amounts of time
out there, in a truly remote location, despite some proximity to
civilization. At the furthest point of my property from the road, I
staged my RV, in a suitable spot that would conveniently support my
preparatory construction activities I was planning.</p>
<p>Long before buying this property, unfortunately, there were problems
with trespassers. Since the driveway extended from the neighborhood to
near the park, and there were no homes, it mostly resembled an extension
of the park, attracting many people who wanted to walk through. Many of
these people did not have the best intentions, however, and were
frequenting many spots on the property that were not along the driveway,
creating problems for knowing who was out there and when.</p>
<p><img class="ui huge center image transition visible"   src="a-no-trespassing-sign-to-help-prevent-trespass-activities.jpg" /></p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><img class="ui huge center image transition visible"   src="another-of-many-no-trespassing-signs.jpg" /></p>
<p><em>(“No Trespassing” signs intended to inform people that my
property is privately owned and not a park.)</em></p>
<p>A group of neighbors, believing, or otherwise using, the story that a
previous homesteader wanted the driveway to be open for public use, for
access to the state park, hiked though without providing acknowledgement
to landowners that it was the landowner’s land they were traversing.
There was for a very long time an old gate at the beginning of the
property blocking it off from vehicles. My neighbor became the owner of
this gate when he bought his property a little over 5 years before I
bought mine.</p>
<p>One day, upon returning from overseas, he found that his property was
being flooded with hikers. Even a tour bus was reported to have shown
up, dropping off visitors for access to the park. The roadway near the
gate was lined with cars. The neighbors nearby where not happy, and
neither was he, so he took the steps to reinforce the gate to prevent
pedestrian traffic, and took an active stance against outsiders showing
up to hike, without providing any acknowledgement to landowners.</p>
<p>There were plenty of other access routes to the park around
Anchorage, and this was private property. Nevertheless, this event of
extending and fortifying the gate, that was easily bypassed by
pedestrians before, created conflict—between my neighbor and people who
thought they were entitled to continue walking through to the park.</p>
<p>Just a few years later, my wife and I come onto the scene. We learn
about some issues with hikers, but are fine with allowing those who are
willing to provide acknowledgement, and sign an agreement, to come
through. Despite this, some refused to sign agreements and took a
hostile stance against use, and forcibly walked though, despite anything
we might say about wanting to come to an agreement about how access
should take place.</p>
<p>Today, newly and uncomfortably single, my resources are largely
depleted, and I’m stuck in a lawsuit, with many neighbors who believe
they have a right to cross through my property.</p>
<p>Solitude would not be as easy to get as I thought, even though my
property is mostly inaccessible to the public, and is quite far from any
other home.</p>
<p>One day, in May 2019, I’m alone in my RV. Trying my best to enjoy
myself, despite all that has gone awry in my life, when suddenly some
men pass through. I hear them chatting loudly outside the RV, on a lower
portion of my driveway, not more than 50-100 feet away, depending on
what portion they were walking through. Annoyed that I had unwanted
visitors, I tried to ignore them, and was mostly successful. They hiked
past, up towards the park, and all went quiet again.</p>
<p>While for the most part I do not worry about people who pass through,
I do have security concerns. This location is very far from the road,
and I had no means of communication. I also did not want any means of
communication. Instead, I only wanted neighbors who were safe to pass
through, and for everyone else, I wanted to be concerned about them…
Just as anyone wants to be able to identify strangers, and separate them
from those who are known and approved of, especially at home.</p>
<p>What is unique in this case, is the remoteness. I’m alone, and there
are men walking through, who are likely armed, and sometimes they return
at night. In this case they did not return at night. It seems they made
their way down the driveway, to the end, but not the park, and then
turned around. Because soon after they passed by, they returned. This
time, however, they stopped near my RV, and began chatting loudly. This
is where it became clear to me they were trying to provoke my attention
with harassment, possibly with the desire to create a reaction, and as I
would soon confirm, a they were opportunists wanting to create a story
to gain media attention, and perhaps local fame for themselves. While
this may seem like it is a small scale issue, it turns out it involves
Anchorage politicians, up to the Mayor of Anchorage, and perhaps people
operating at the state level. Current litigation may unearth exactly how
widespread interest in this case is, but at the moment it is confirmed
that all levels of Municipal authority in Anchorage have been involved.
But this can be explained in depth later.</p>
<p>One man was an amateur journalist, who contacted me once before,
about interviewing me for a story about the controversy. I was polite
with him but ultimately declined, since there were clear signs that he
had negative or at least a partisan, non-agnostic position, that would
have been more becoming of a true journalist. We engaged in an email
conversation when he reached out to me using that medium. At the end our
our conversation, it suddenly soured when he made a veiled threat, or a
joke, about being able to use his chain saw to trail blaze down my
section-line easements.</p>
<p>For those who may not be familiar, as I was not until purchasing this
land, a section-line easement is the portion of the property that anyone
can walk through, although many landowners might not be aware of it. The
borders of a property, around the circumference, are reserved for
various forms of access for utilities and other government purposes.
Anyone from the public can walk down someone’s section line easement.
This would be odd for someone to do, and could provoke conflict and
suspicions about a persons intentions doing it, but technically people
are allowed hike or walk these borders. This is more obvious to us when
we imagine long strips of cleared land we’ve seen, with telephone lines
running down them. Since my property is wild, purchased from the
original homesteader, the section lines are mostly overgrown wilderness,
amounting to wildlife habitat. They are not easily passable. Knowing
this, he said he <em>could</em> trailblaze them to create a path with
his chainsaw, if he wanted to.</p>
<p>Such a comment was entirely disturbing to me, coming from someone who
I had no relationship with at all. He was basically threatening to walk
through these areas with a chainsaw to clear them out, and gain access
however he wanted. And this person was claiming to be a journalist.</p>
<p>A second individual was the owner of a fairly popular blog and news
website that might be characterized as sensationalist, or if not
sensationalist, of local interest. I was tipped off by the son of a
state representative / Alaskan Politician, supposedly representing me,
that I should expect an article to be written about me in this very same
news blog. I knew this person and his wife from my office building,
which functioned as a co-working environment for professionals operating
small businesses, and this environment was totally disconnected from my
property. There was no reason I should be hearing anything about my
property from a casual acquaintance from this workspace. So at this time
I became aware that here was gossip about this issue all across town,
and probably conspiracy, due to the connections with politicians, and
due to other information I had from other parallel activities I was
involved in.</p>
<p>A third man was probably the most active trespasser on my property,
crossing through day and night, and even altering my trails off the
driveway without my permission (based upon report from my neighbor). He
appears to be in his 50s, and perhaps even early 60s. He appears to be
in fairly good shape from making my driveway and other trails around
town his exercise destinations. This was the one person who I
encountered along my driveway who made very odd statements indicating he
was watching me, and was maybe a threat to my well being. I have my
entire interaction with him recorded, and there is no doubt that there
was a disparity between myself and him in politeness and readiness to
come to any kind of agreement. He was very threatening and unusual.</p>
<p>So one person known for walking through with a mission to take the
driveway from me was now loitering near my RV; he was walking through
with another guy who was journalist who threatened me; and the third
person was an owner of a sensationalist online newspaper. By all
appearances they had a mission coming out to pay me a visit, in a
location where no one else stayed in one place for any long duration,
except me.</p>
<p>And they were yelling out all sorts of pseudo-conversation with
references to me, and my life, to either irritate me, or provoke me to
come out. And I gave them what they wanted. I grabbed my things, put on
my boots, and snatched my go-pro camera to let them know they were not
welcome. A mile into wilderness, were three men, near my RV, and
possessions, a half mile across my property, trying to cajole me to
create a story.</p>
<p>I got in my truck, drove down my driveway to a common intersection
where the two parts of my driveway come together, and I parked across
the width of the driveway, perpendicular with the route they had to take
to get back. My intention was not to prevent them from crossing back. On
the contrary, I wanted to ensure they would cross my path, so I could
force acknowledgement that the property was mine, question them, and
encourage them to depart through my property, faster than they came
in.</p>
<p>During this encounter, I filmed them. I have all of it on camera. And
since I had my camera out, the journalist decided to take out his phone,
and capture photos or otherwise take video himself as well. While this
was happening, and I was telling them I wanted to leave, of course they
argued that they had a right to be there. I argued that they did not,
and insisted that they leave. The one older man, who is known for
passing through and being disrespectful and threatening, told me
“There’s three of us” and made me feel immediately threatened. They
slowly made their way around my truck, and began walking down the
driveway back. Again, trying to provoke a response, that same man, as
they finally decided to just leave, said</p>
<p>“Well, at least he didn’t pull a gun.”</p>
<p>I was unarmed, although as a matter of fact, I usually am armed out
there. There are wild animals, and people like him passing through at
night, and it is the norm to have weapons for self protection in Alaska.
But on this particular occasion, I had the presence of mind to realize
they probably would try to make something out of nothing. And so I was
unarmed, and only had camera in hand. And fortunately, I caught the
entire interaction on camera.</p>
<p>Not long after this interaction, the story was finally published on
that website, by that journalist, with photos taken during the
interaction. Including an unflattering photo of myself holding the go
pro, feeling quite irritated that I had to clothe myself and grab my
camera, to deal with trespassers at such a remote location. It’s
equivalent to having to walk out of your home to see a stranger who
knocks on your door, who is yelling into your home, when you are in your
pajamas and expect and desire no visitors.</p>
<p>Although the photograph was unflattering, and slanderous in my
opinion, it does show that I was, indeed, unarmed, and makes it really
apparent that this man was trying to force a reaction, and make a really
uncalled for veiled accusation.</p>
<p>The article itself was better written than I anticipated. It was more
balanced than I thought it would be. However, it presented one highly
skewed perspective, and there were many details missing, and many
statements that were incomplete or false.</p>
<p>For one thing they were trespassers, and of course they did not say
they were. I used this situation as evidence against them, and have an
open criminal case against all three of them for criminal trespass. It
is now in the hands of the prosecutor to complete the case, but as
always in Anchorage, it appears corruption is at play and I’m not sure
it will comet to a real resolution.</p>
<p>But the story, and its falsity, and the way it was obtained, all
provide me strong motivation for completing my book.</p>
<p>I thought to myself, “Why were these people taking such an aggressive
stance towards me? They knew nothing about who I am, and took no steps
to welcome me to my new property. Didn’t they realize, I moved out here
married, with dreams of living in the ways they themselves admire? Like
a real homesteader? Buying land, building a small home, trying to be off
grid in the wilderness? Didn’t they realize what I lost in the process?
How much I invested? What they are doing to me, aside from simply
walking past my RV and trying to provoke me?”</p>
