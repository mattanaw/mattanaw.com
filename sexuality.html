<h2 id="introduction"><a name="introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>Sexuality in my view appears to relate to much more than procreation,
and desire to have relations with others, that have certain
characteristics of attraction and or expectation of sexual behavior. It
appears that sexuality relates to how we are able to have aesthetic
experiences the way that we have them. There seem to be relationships of
interest between our appreciation of art and our appreciation of animal
beauty, and it is strongest perhaps in our noticing of others who seem
to be desired candidates for sexual interaction. Objects that we enjoy
have been named using women’s names and have been called “sexy”, for
having a draw which appears to relate, again, to animal characteristics
of beauty, like symmetry and some similarity to faces. The evolution of
animals implies a long history of sexual development and appreciation
for certain sightings of other animals that seem pleasant, among people
and animals who rely greatly on vision. People also rely on cues that
are not visual which have aesthetic properties relating to sexuality,
including voice, and this is then used within music in interesting ways.
Deep sounds are related to male properties, whereas higher pitch sounds
are related to those of women, and variations of pitch of both men and
women are related to various psychological states which relate to
sexuality and desire.</p>
<p>Here I will provide considerable information regarding my own
sexuality in a candid and open way, to provide an example that relates
to my philosophy, and findings in my scientific approach. I have
collected data on my own sexual experiences of attraction to give myself
opportunity to study myself in a way that is honest and
autobiographical, and also to have opportunity to study my own sexuality
in a way to make it more scientific, even if the data is primarily about
myself only. I think readers will find that this honest treatment will
provide something of use to themselves and others. Since there is
considerable diversity I expect many will read this and think my mind is
quite unlike their own as it relates to sexual desire and attraction.
However, I think most would agree that my approach is of use to them
also; and that my experience is representative to a large extent the
experiences of many who are of greater similarity to me than maybe
themselves. Some will read this and think “this is just like me, or very
close”, and for these readers especially I hope I can provide additional
clarity on whatever experience seems to be shared. Either way I think
insight into sexuality generally will be provided to anyone who reads
this.</p>
<p>There are some controversial topics I wish to cover knowing that they
relate to lingering issues in social life. One such topic is the natural
vs. appropriate targets of sexual attractiveness to a male in
particular, but with commentary on what might also be natural
vs. appropreiate for women. A definite topic of interest is sexual
interest as it relates to age. “Who might I expect or anticipate I may
be interested in sexually naturally, if I’m a male, independent of any
consideration as to what is appropriate or considered moral in a
culture?” is a question a child might ask, in other words of course, but
not get an honest answer to. I think most are unable to actually answer
this effectively for themselves or others, but rather conform in their
self-talk and communications with others, while also experiencing
cognitively, various sudden interests in others who are outside of what
is appropriate. I think this is a universal experience, which means that
for any person taken at random, they willl not have an agreement between
what they know they are interested in naturally from time to time and
what they really think is appropriate, or how they talk about the topic
to themselves and others. People will notice certain inclinations and
then try to explain to themselves that that is not who they are, or that
it is not really in their natural sexuality to have such inclinations.
However, that would imply that there is an exacting match between social
norms and sexual interest. If one examines life as maturing school age
children, and teens, one knows that there has certainly been natural
sexual interests which feel natural but later are no longer considered
allowable and appropriate. If one made a circle diagram comparing what
society expects and what one experiences psychologically, one would find
definitely that for all people, there would not be a perfect alignment,
meaning that they would not be the same circles. Another demonstration
of this is that cultures do not have the same social norms and rules,
which means you would be out of alignment with the expectations of
another culture and they would be out of alignment with yours, and the
cultures themselves would not be in alignment. Universally then, it
appears natural interest is larger than what is considered
appropriate.</p>
<p>I will spend considerable time sharing my view concerning my own
sexuality including my own natural interests and what I think society
expects from me, and what can be inferred from this more generally about
human aesthetic experience, and general sexuality. After lengthy
discussion of this topic I will transition to what I think is relevant
to moral philosophy and ethics, particularly as it relates to my system
of ethics. Some might think by raising the topic of moral philosophy and
ethics that I am prepared to make certain judgements as to people’s
behavior which is private, or my own behavior. However, my thinking even
within my moral philosophy is scientific. The objectives aren’t merely
to create prohibitions concerning behavior, but to put behaviors in
context of a naturalistic description of behavior which is more complete
and more descriptive in ways than what has been provided by popular
culture, and perhaps others sources on the same topic. The objective is
to have accurate knowledge. Accurate knowledge of how things are and how
things unfold creates something akin to a forgiveness on behavior which
is discovered or confirmed to be natural and common, or natural and
recurring regularly, since some are behaving in natural ways but their
particular culture has considered it inappropriate or unacceptable, or
something to keep private. Keeping sexual behavior private, while
discretionary, does create an effect of mutual non-understanding. One’s
private behavior seems like something that would be embarassing if
exposed, even if the behavior is normal, or less common but recurring
over millenia, or less common, but with many examples nevertheless in
present times. Privacy can create a feeling that one is alone in
experience, when really many are experiencing or are doing the same. So
again, a natural zoological undersatanding of human behavior, which is
anthropology, is helpful for making one feel one’s behavior is not
really not permissible.</p>
<p>Then there is the topic of human excellences and what one may do to
advance selves in various ways to be better on certain measures than
they already are. For example, this is a topic of interest regarding
sexually transmitted infections, diseases, and illnesses. I will also
share my experiences candidly regarding my own behavior, and what I’ve
done to self-protect regarding sexual illnesses, in comparison to what
is expected by society, and what plans really exist in relation to
risks. I have <a href="open-health-mattanaw.html">health-data</a> that I
have shared and will continue to share relating to testing on sexual
infections and transferrable diseases. To provide some indication of
where I’m moving with this topic, I think people are very poorly
equipped regarding plans and training for preventing sexual illnesses,
but people pretend openly that their behavior conforms to what is
expected, but what is expected is largely absurd.</p>
<p>Similarly, I think there are connections between this topic and the
ethics of planning children. I have argued elsewhere that child having
is largely a side effect of sexual desire and less about active planning
of children. The lack of societal planning and preparation of individual
ability to avoid sexual transmitted disease is related to inability to
plan effectively around transmitting what is required to create
children. In other words people will be having accidental or side effect
children, more often I think than deliberate child birth. Even
deliberate childbirth is often the result of long periods of sexual
behavior which finally results in the desired effect, interpreted as
having an actual child. Howver, this differs from visions as to what is
desired even when it is deliberate, and planning seems to be uninformed
regarding the fact that any child had must not be ultimately what is
really wanted, since people are unable to predict what their child would
be like in advance. So planning appears to be lacking where it is rarely
deliberate, and obviously lacking when it doesn’t exist, in the more
common case where people simply have children as side effects of sexual
desire. Although very definitely this makes it clear that planning has
not been great regarding having children, and this relates to planning
around sexuality, it does fit us nicely in context with animal life on
earth which has been assured to continue for some extended period
because having children does not require planning. Instead, animals
merely have to have a strong desire to periodically mate, and have sex,
and this really does result in having offspring. Earth will continue to
have new offspring from all animals because of plain desire for mating
and not from planning.</p>
<p>However, once again, moral excellences may be had that are not
presently extremely common. Knowledge can also provide forgivenesses of
sorts fitting people into natural animal contexts, including the natural
context of real human behavior. Greater knowledge on sexuality can
create better planning and therefore relates to moral behavior and moral
excellences. Moral excellences may include sexuality in ways which may
not be anticipated by those who expect confirmation of current day moral
standards. However since current day moral standards do not include
realistic planning and training of individuals to really arrive at
sexual excellences, it is understood that there is plenty of room for
development. There is avery big gap in morality regarding what is
possible regarding behavior, particularly with considerable knowledge
and very extensive self-training. Imagine if plans for sexuality were
really knowledgeable, realistic, and tailored to someone like you, and
were available to you for your own additions and improvements, before
you were born? Imagine they were provided to you when you were young.
Imagine if they didn’t necessarily think your natural behaviors were
inappropriate even if they did not correspond with certain expectations,
but instead were accepting in various ways, because of the way that
nature plays out without possibility of alteration, and with an
understanding of sponteneity?</p>
<p>In keeping with the rest of this <a href="#introduction.html">Book
and Journal</a>, and its structure, this book’s objective is to convey
another ethic and moral philosophy while simultaneously providing my
living autobiography, which intermixes with it. I use what I write here
which makes my life, and my life is largely about learning and writing
here. I really have mixed my writings over the years which appear here
in with my own behavior. Sometiems I behaved spontaneously in ways which
did not yet have moral teachings and I’ve used those experienced to
create moral teachings for myself. Other times I anticipated life to
come from readings of others, and from attending to what older people
say and do, and have avoided certain behaviors I would not have wanted
for myself. This is particularly the case regarding drug use and
addiction, where I’ve been very successful avoiding issues. Other times
plain observation and inferences about human natural behavior, like a
zoologist watching the zoo of human-animals around me, that I’m also
contained in, have allowed me to make certain decisions which have
seemed to be beneficial for my life, like not having children. I know
this has benefited my life, but also recognize some side effects of this
choice, and see also that others may benefit from having children, again
if it relates to moral excellences, or better decisions fitting on a
more knowledgeable moral philosophy like the one I’m sharing. If one is
interested in writings here one may find others within this book
interesting, and again in those locaitions, covering most of my life,
the ethic mixes with my own autobiography.</p>

<h2
id="age-scaling-mathematical-series-and-attractiveness"><a name="attractiveness-and-mathematics">Age,
Scaling, Mathematical Series, and Attractiveness</a></h2>
<p>After birth your growth has scaling and series-like properties which
appear to have some potential for mathematization. Complexity limits
biologists in their ability to depict this scale and series, but there
appear to be some places where simplicity exists, providing clear
insights, more easily communicated. Conscillience of experience and
science appear to show, for example, that there are uniformities of
scaling and series relating to aging and attractiveness. This may
provide a way for achieving a greater unification of sciences, including
aesthetics, biology, mathematics, chemistry, physics and moral
philosophy.</p>
<p>In a recent share of an incipient idea with the high intelligence
community, I provided notes related to a potential psuedo-proof or
potential proof, greatly resembling a mathematical one, with some
missing pieces which appear mainly statistical, indicating preference
for youth in sexuality (Mattanaw, 2023). I’m aware there would be
differences between males and females, and others, that account for a
need to modify the proof slightly depending on which group or individual
is being considered, however it is believed that this really does appear
to point to a uniformity in human sexuality, and probably a uniformity
in animal sexualy for a large number of species. Those notes were
cursory and pointed direction for my own advancements on this topic,
which are here explored.</p>
<p>It may be useful, from the start, to show the mathematical
partial-proof, of such a complex and interdisciplinary topic. Then it
will be discussed what is missing, and what is weaker in the proof.
Following an honest discussion of weaknesses, will be a discussion of
strengths and possible ways to develop on this finding.</p>
<p>The prior section in this work will explain my own views as to my own
attractions of others, with some possible generalizations. It must be
known that I can speak best for myself although I am adept at thinking
objectively, and naturally do that. But that objectivity would be
incomplete, and so there are limits to my ability to perspective-swtich.
This proof is focused more on my experience, and yet is still expected,
to generalize, with modifications. Notice that sexuality, is understood
to be sexuality. This implies thre is an understanding of boundaries and
scope, and thinking in a Darwinian way, that there are definite bridges
between note only people, but between much of the animal kingdom,
explaining evolution. Your sexuality has components that are
generalizable, and this means the same for my own sexuality.</p>
<p>It is expected that readers will find points of disagreement. For any
point of disagreement, it is likely that the author knows, or agrees
with the contention. It is not possible to cover all contentions or
already envisioned areas of disagreement.</p>
<h3 id="semi-formal-partial-sci-mathematical-proof">Semi-formal partial
sci-mathematical proof:</h3>
<p><strong><em>Definitions</em></strong></p>
<p>Let <em>D</em> designate an object corresponding to a daughter, of a
number of children. <em>D</em> is a potential hypthetical spouse I’m
considering for marriage. We will treat <em>D</em> as a real
number<sup>1</sup>, although we will recall also it is a person who is a
complex object with properties.</p>
<p><em>D</em> ages in time, and this allows us to order <em>M</em> in
time on a series M<sub>delta t</sub>, which we conveniently increment on
seconds<sup>2</sup>. M as a zygote, from fertilization of egg and sperm,
or from meiotic identical twinning, has a series starting at
D<sub>t=0</sub>, and at death, which is not understood well, but can be
understood for simplification as medically decided death, is
D<sub>t(death)-t(0)</sub>. This allows us to arrange M on a series as
follows:</p>
<p>D<sub>0</sub>, D<sub>1</sub>, …, D<sub>t(death)</sub></p>
<p>The entire life and appearances of D, fall between D<sub>0</sub> and
D<sub>t(death)</sub>, and a real series in time<sup>3</sup>, and a
subset of this what is seen by myself considering M as a spouse.</p>
<p>We will also note, that we have different words M in growth to death,
and maturization. We will omit these and only use the series. It is
expected this will indicate the series is more valuable and math-like
than one might immediately think. Words in language would lead one to
think there is not a series, and take focus from the series, while we
are aware that all words for stages of maturization are less words, than
a simple measure of age.</p>
<p>We will introduce further daughter <em>D</em>. Mother has formed a
zygote for Daughter D sexually at time M<sub>t(conception)</sub>.
T<sub>conception</sub>, we will say is t=19. For the daughter there is a
life-series:</p>
<p>D<sub>0</sub>, D<sub>1</sub>, …, D<sub>t(death)</sub></p>
<p><strong><em>Assumptions</em></strong></p>
<p><em>Assumption 1.</em></p>
<p>Assumptions are required to give a clarified example. We will assume,
thatfor M and D, there aren’t extreme changes along path of maturity. It
is known that this will occur, however, we will rely on statistical
expectations of typical age progression. For example, M &amp; D will be
thinner in youth, and will put on weight. They will grow in height. They
will have development of primary and secondary sex characteristics, some
on milestones, some on series. There are many parallel changes of traits
too numerous to mention, but in appearances visible, much goes according
to expectations. Maturity is somewhat well understood for appearances
and for individual experience there are many people to see (they are
experiential scientists on their own seeing of other people in
lifespan). Compare the greatness of the supply of information with not
having information.</p>
<p>M &amp; D have their lives recorded, in time-step, on seconds, to
show time-lapse of their aging. So you could watch a fast video to see
their aging. Their aging shows what appears to be normal human againg,
with no serious disease or conditions, similar to prior generations
(expected).</p>
<p><em>Assumption 2.</em></p>
<p>D is genetically highly similar to M.</p>
<p><strong><em>Axioms</em></strong></p>
<p>Here we will introduce the notion that a legitimately trusted
cultural heuristic may be employed as an axiom, with a need for
statistical precision). In other words, it is already trusted as premise
in arguments, and as a premise of moral behavior. However, a complete
scientific justification of the pemise, on statistics, and modelling,
and exact fitting of models to data, is lacking. Predictive power exists
and medically assumed for some such premises (for example, that genetic
similars, will have increasingly analogical inferential instruments
based on similarity, scaling from identical twins to separate animals).
This simply says, it is well-known, and required knowledge, that people
who are genetically related, have similarities of interest. It is
culturally and medically accepted, but something such as genetic
similarity in family resemblance is still not complete enough to know
that soundness of arguments exists for certain, and doesn’t have a
complete statistical justification according to a combined error
expectation for any or all object properties, separate or in
combination.</p>
<p>So this a trusted premise that has experiential information in its
favor to an extent of cultural assumption.</p>
<p><em>Axiom 1.</em></p>
<p><em>Axiom 2.</em></p>
<p>This axiom is similar to an assumption, and an axiom is a more
trusted than usual assumption. One can say there are no axioms but a
scaling on assumptions, and that assumptions are reused premises. That
taste for myself MATTANAW is nearly a constant. There is a core
constant, with a periphery of taste, that bounds all taste MATTANAW has,
and describes the lack of huge variety. An important example, is that I
don’t want any other species, and want less any other race of people,
which is supported by Darwinism.</p>
<p><em>Axiom 3.</em></p>
<p>If D and M have similar lives and sufficiently similar DNA, they
approach identicals or clones. With sufficient similarity, if MATTANAW
likes D, then MATTANAW likes M, and vice versa. Just as MATTANAW would
like twins. This can be expressed as</p>
<p>In recordings of D, nude, at D<sub>maturity</sub></p>
<p>and</p>
<p>In recordings of M, nude, at M<sub>maturity</sub></p>
<p>If one is pornographically of interst, the other would be.</p>
<p>M = D with respect to appearance<sup>4</sup></p>
<p><strong><em>Argument-Proof Steps</em></strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Let D be daughter, with lifetime depicted as steps
D<sub>t(conception)</sub> through D<sub>n=t(death)</sub>, or
D<sub>1</sub>…D<sub>n</sub></li>
<li>Let M be mother, with lifetime depicted as steps
M<sub>t(conception)</sub> through M<sub>n=t(death)</sub>, or
M<sub>1</sub>…M<sub>n</sub></li>
<li>Axiom 3. M<sub>maturity</sub> = D<sub>maturity</sub></li>
<li>Axiom 2. M<sub>t=not-too-aged</sub> =
D<sub>t=not-too-aged</sub></li>
<li>Axiom 1. To know if the daughter will be of interest later, one
checks the mother at some t-not-too-aged. If still attractive, one
expects a parallel attractiveness series for D and M. I.e. the marriage
will work regarding attractiveness.</li>
<li>Following 5, for D and M there are corresponding parallel series of
expected attractiveness, which are M<sub>maturity</sub> …
M<sub>t=not-too-aged</sub> = D<sub>maturity</sub> …
D<sub>t=not-too-aged</sub>.</li>
<li>For the parallel series, for any time t, M = D regarding
attractiveness, and D = M, bounded according to 6.</li>
<li>Axiom 4. Strength of attraction is related to age, as
M<sub>maturity</sub> &gt; M<sub>t=not-too-aged</sub>, and also
D<sub>maturity</sub> &gt; D<sub>t=not-too-aged</sub>, which implies D =
M, for attractiveness, where time is equal. “The life of the mother is
similar to the life of the dauther, and vice versa, regarding
attractiveness to others.” Notice it’s expected the mother can
teach</li>
<li>Axiom 5. Mother can teach daughter, including recursively the axioms
themselves. The axioms are heuristic cultural devices which would be
what could be taught. Nothing else exists that could be taught if not
similar expected experience. If there is no recurring analog there is
nothing to teach!</li>
</ol>
<p>Conclusions</p>
<p><em>Conclusions are only inferences of interest coming from premises,
but not terminating even at the conclusions. (conclusions are
premises).</em></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Daughters are identical to mothers in attractiveness, one is less
than the other on attractiveness, regarding comparison of age, in sub t.
If the mother is seen younger, in recorded images, video, or
pornography, she will be preferable to the daugther at any age.
Daughers, being living similars to recordings, are preferable already,
in actual time, for being earlier than mothers. The same is true the
other way around.</li>
<li>As in Indian culture, a mother can be used to predict if a daugther
will be compatible. (Assumes taste is unchanging in MATTANAW, according
to Axiom N).<br />
</li>
<li>Similar to 2, then, attractiveness to a mother can be proven by
attractiveness to a daughter. [I can show why I like someone older with
someone younger who clarifies what looks good in the older].</li>
</ol>
<p>Potential Conclusions</p>
<p><em>Potential conclusions includes what is thought to possibly be
inferrable, on intuition, to what has been explained, perhaps with
additional known and shared experiential information.</em></p>
