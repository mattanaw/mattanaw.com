<p><em>Published October 30th 2019</em></p>
<p>This page contains lists that I consider important, for a variety of
reasons.</p>
<p>Each relates to moral philosophy in a number of ways.</p>
<p>Initially there will only be a few lists here, but later this page
may be among the most lengthy and useful.</p>
<p>It will be updated very frequently.</p>

<h2 id="words-likely-to-falsify-sentences.">Words likely to falsify
sentences.</h2>
<p>The first and primary objective of a teacher of logic is to rid the
world of obvious falsities, in order to move forward to find truths.</p>
<p>People are stuck forever in obvious falsities that they can easily be
freed from.</p>
<p>Instantly nearly.</p>
<p>Well, they can see the extent of the issue nearly instantly.</p>
<p>There is a life-long process of trying to fully rid oneself from
superstitions and errors.</p>
<p>But the most obvious errors can be cancelled from your life very
quickly.</p>
<p>I can’t pretend to have practiced myself out of this issue
completely, but I am continually improving. The best improvement I ever
made was to stop paying any attention to the superstitions and falsities
that plague humanity.</p>
<p>The goal of the list below is to help others see what may be rejected
without much thought or effort. More importantly, you can reject these
ideas and <em>never give any credit to them ever again as potentially
true concepts</em>.</p>
<p>I can’t list everything I want to include here. The best I can do is
add items as they come to mind. If you know others that can be added to
this list, simply reject them instantly yourself and add to your own
mental-list.</p>
<p>Some readers may disagree with some items listed below. Don’t forget
that the key point in the lists below is to confidently exclude things
from consideration that are almost certainly going to lead you to
falsity.</p>
<p>If you have solid grounds for retaining some of the items below (very
few), then you can do that and still benefit from the lists.</p>
<p>However, I would suggest you adopt all of the items in each list as
terms that would lead you to falsity.</p>
<p>Take a look at the diagram below I wrote on my whiteboard (I highly
recommend having a whiteboard to sort things out). This might give some
additional clarification of what it is I’m trying to achieve with this
basic list.</p>

mean “teacher”, and in that case, teacher is fine. It is especially
false when it is capitalized).

</ul>
<h4 id="exaggeration-improper-placement-on-a-spectrum.">Exaggeration,
improper placement on a spectrum.</h4>
<p>These are the words I like to correct by telling myself
“Est-est”.</p>
<p>Bigestest, Tallestest, Largestest, etc… to make it sound ridiculous
or to otherwise make the exaggeration clear.</p>
<ul>
<li>Biggest</li>

<li>Fastest</li>
<li>Smallest</li>
<li>Weakest</li>

<li>Strangest</li>

</ul>
<h4 id="overgeneralization">Overgeneralization</h4>
<p>These are directly related to the concepts above, because they
involve failure to properly measure on a spectrum.</p>
<ul>
<li>Always</li>
<li>Mostly (this one is more tricky to notice, but usually results in
falsehood from what I’ve observed, when numbers are large).</li>

catastrophe</h4>
<ul>
<li>Ruined</li>
<li>Destroyed</li>
<li>Abandoned</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="false-triumphs">False triumphs</h3>
<ul>
<li>First. “He was the first to do [something many have done, or
something unverifiable or supernatural].”</li>
<li>Last. “He was the last person on the battlefield.” “He was the last
prophet.”
<ul>
<li>Alternatively, fans of sports will say “He was the last to be able
to do…” because of some change in the sport, to magnify trivial
accomplishments.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Statistical or Data Related Factoids, magnified into triumphs.</li>
<li>False heroism.
<ul>
<li>(We do this when folks have made sacrifices. It is more accurate to
recognize the sacrifices).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>False villainy to make someone’s triumph seem more appealing. I.e.
you make your enemy subhuman to glorify your own accomplishments, as in
WWII. Dehumanization, caricature.</li>
<li>“Greatest”, “Greatest in History”, “Greatest in the World”,
“Greatest of All Time”.
<ul>
<li>without making comparisons or using private criteria, or examining
the world, or knowing history, or covering all time.</li>
<li>Especially offensive when it excludes people who are not in a
position to be considered.</li>
<li>“Smartest person in the world”, as if that person is not
impoverished. That person is probably impoverished, at least if we are
considering native capability. The smartest person in history is someone
who there is no record of, and probably little to no “success”. This is
a viable argument given probabilities.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="excess-certainty-definiteness-definitiveness.">Excess certainty,
definiteness, definitiveness.</h4>
<p>Also related to inability to place on a spectrum (notice the trend
concerning the spectrum?).</p>
<ul>
<li>Definitely</li>
<li>Guaranteed</li>
<li>Absolutely</li>
<li>Certainly</li>
</ul>
<h4
id="excess-enthusiasm-or-estimation-of-aesthetic-quality-or-lack-of-quality">Excess
enthusiasm, or estimation of aesthetic quality, or lack of quality</h4>
<p>These may feel harsh, but if you look at what you’re saying
carefully, you’ll discover you go straight to these words when the
feeling just doesn’t justify it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Amazing</li>
<li>Fantastic</li>
<li>Beautiful</li>
<li>Good</li>
<li>Incredible</li>
<li>Fascinating</li>
<li>Genius</li>
<li>Brilliant</li>
<li>Delicious</li>
</ul>
<p>I feel better departing from using the terms below, than the ones
above.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hideous</li>
<li>Ugly</li>
<li>Repulsive</li>
<li>Evil</li>
<li>Bad</li>
<li>Disgusting</li>
<li>Gross</li>
<li>Horrible</li>
<li>Horrendous</li>
<li>Idiotic</li>
<li>Moronic</li>
<li>Retarded</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="unity-oneness-and-singularity">Unity, Oneness, and
Singularity</h4>
<p>This is an error to be watchful for. There are no concepts to
completely reject in this list. Instead, there is a tendency to guard
against, of creating false oneness in collections of things, or a
preference for holistic perspectives such that reductionistic
non-holistic perspectives are ignored.</p>
<p>All of the items below are common when rhetoric and persuasion is
being used. We tend to enjoy the simplicity of these terms, and we react
more emotionally when they are used, versus when we are more specific
and accurate.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Unity, united, indivisible, inseparable.</em>
<ul>
<li>‘We are united’ when there are detractors, or if it pretends to be
all inclusive based on some smaller sample of members, or when it is
questionable that there could be any discernible unity among people and
objects with many differences to begin with.</li>
<li>“America is United” would always be false, for example for every
reason above.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>One, oneness.</em>
<ul>
<li>E.g. ‘We are one’. Similar to the above. This is an error of
over-generalization and/or oversimplification. It is also used to the
effect that the alternative perspective that items can be taken
individually is ignored.</li>
<li>“One nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all” creates
a false sense of oneness, and excess unity.</li>
<li>For example, on Earth Day, people might say that “we are one with
the Earth.” This can be used in absurd arguments, that forget that while
we can think of the Earth as one thing, we can also think of the earth
as composed of many individual parts. In philosophy this involves the
old problem of “the one and the many” since composite objects can be
seen as singular things, but also as complexes of smaller parts making
up the whole.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Wholeness, Holism.</em>
<ul>
<li>When used, again, to indicate that a collection of things is just a
single thing, that cannot be better understood in terms of parts that
compose “it”. Sometimes it is questionable if the “thing” in question is
one or more things. This is particularly true in psychology, where we
cannot always tell if what we are experienced is really one thing, or a
number of things, even though it might be perceived as one thing. Our
personal identity itself is something that is questionable here, because
we can’t tell really if we are one thing or more than one thing, or if
our perception at any given time is one perception or a number of
perceptions, and so on.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Concepts themselves</em>
<ul>
<li>implying unity when there might be diversity, and oneness when there
might be more than one thing falling under one category inappropriately.
This is due to organic and asystematic development of concepts.</li>
<li>Concepts automatically imply a kind of unity and oneness, that is
often questionable.</li>
<li>“Love” would be an example. This is an issue with many concepts
where distinctions would reveal important differences, without which,
would lead to identifying different things as the same. An example of
this is the zoological taxonomy system in biology. This is an ongoing
issue that must be dealt with as we get better and better knowledge
about things, because we begin with few concepts, and later need more to
describe important differences.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>The, a, it</em>
<ul>
<li>as used to indicate that there is only one of a certain thing that
there might be many of.</li>
<li>“The 12 Rules of Life” as might be found in a book title. This would
create the false impression that there is one single set of 12 rules,
and no additional rules are necessary. This conceals arbitrariness.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Singular use when a plural is called for.</em>
<ul>
<li>E.g. “It all happened for a reason” is my usual example. “It all”
implies complexity, and complexity often implies numerous causes or
reasons for numerous collected and interconnected occurrences. It is
much more accurate to say, “These events happened for many reasons”.
Notice that this is no longer compelling. For some reason, we are
emotionally invested in unities and onenesses that don’t exist. Once we
are more accurate, the statements are less emotionally charged.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="common-linguistic-issues-that-lead-to-error">Common Linguistic
Issues that Lead to Error</h3>
<ul>
<li>Not recognizing a metaphor as a metaphor. Metaphors are not as safe
as similes.
<ul>
<li>Claiming that someone is like something, will probably make it clear
that they are not actually that thing.</li>
<li>Claiming that someone <em>is</em> something, metaphorically, will be
lost on people oftentimes. Even if it is understood, recollections are
altered. Suddenly they are identified with each other.</li>
<li>This is not to say don’t use metaphors. It is to say you ought to be
aware of dangers of metaphors.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="confusions-relating-to-time">Confusions relating to time</h3>
<ul>
<li>“Eternal”, “Endless”
<ul>
<li>Some might say that any given event is “eternal”, yet there is no
indication that anything is kept, retained, or permanently recorded in
nature. In other words, there is no reason to assume that there is
anything that persists for an unending period of time.</li>
<li>There is no example of anything whatsoever that we can confirm to be
eternal.</li>
<li>If you care about it, you can almost certainly assume that it will
<em>not</em> exist forever; and not the contrary assumption that it
<em>will</em> exist forever, because you happen to care about it.</li>
<li>Consider how ridiculous the assumption that everything you dislike
will last forever, but that everything you care about will end.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="fiction-list.">Fiction list.</h3>
<p>We cannot have reality-similar elaborate truths concerning fictions,
in the same way that we can have them about reality.</p>
<p>Truths about reality expand. The story gets larger. The stories of
fictions tend to be stuck in history. They do not grow, unless the
author expands upon it, using a mind, that itself holds much less
information, than reality itself.</p>
<p>Thus Harry Potter is clearly a fiction, since once the author has
completed the work, it is “locked up” in the books.</p>
<p>A new writer could elect to expand on the story, but it is no longer
the story. In any case, the same issue occurs. It is locked up in the
book after the second author has died, and there are still only two
brains involved, which cannot store more information (nowhere close to
as much) as reality itself.</p>
<p>Science on the other hand grows and grows because it is simply
recording from reality.</p>
<p>We can know that works of fiction are indeed fictional, or that parts
are fictional, because they have characteristics more similar to works
of fiction, than to works about reality.</p>
<p>We can add items to our list of things we can instantly reject on
this basis.</p>
<ul>
<li>“Heaven” appears to be fictional.
<ul>
<li>No person can supply additional details beyond what was written,
implying that no one has experienced it, and that the writing itself is
the source of the invention. This is not the only test but it is a
critical test.</li>
<li>What heaven is like, and how long it lasts, in detail. Think of the
detail that could be provided about what Canada is like.</li>
<li>It cannot be known that an afterlife would last forever, and no-one
could provide any details to indicate what this would be like.
<ul>
<li>For example, if there were an afterlife, it could be that you would
die there too. This must be admitted. However, we would also have to
admit, that we made that up. We could provide many alternatives about
the duration of heaven, and all would be inventions. They are attempts
at fleshing out a very short fiction, whose shortness indicates its
nonexistence. Notice how there is little detail about what Heaven is,
even though it would be very important, to be able to confirm that it
is, what supposedly it is. You can provide nearly endless detail about a
photograph of your bedroom you grew up sleeping in, but you can’t
provide nearly any detail about what heaven is supposed to be, and you
could confirm the existence of your bedroom, but you could not confirm
the existence of heaven. The key to this is reality-based detail that is
not dreamt up.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>We cannot have as much detail about heaven as we can about the
universe, but heaven is supposedly eternal, while the universe is not.
If this does not convince you because the “universe” is too large,
simply compare the potential information we have about Earth and what we
have about heaven. We have an infinitesimally small amount of
information about heaven, because it was written by an author of
fiction.<br />
</li>
<li>Fictions written from scratch can have details that connect to
reality, such that we can make them seem really detailed. But we can
never read a piece of fiction, and fill it with the same amount of
detail we could provide about a real situation in life, and feel
confident that our fiction is actually true.</li>
<li>This means we can not only give up on the ideas of “Heaven” and
“Hell” as listed above, but we can verify their falsity by the lack of
detail, and our lack of ability to confirm, even if we went to one or
the other, that it is what we said it was. For example, Hell and Heaven
could potentially transform from one into the other after some period of
time, and back again. So you could believe you’ve entered Heaven and
stay there a very long time, then stay in Hell a much longer time. But
this is all fantasy, and that’s the point. We have no details about what
it is, and we can reject it immediately</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The Tooth Fairy</li>
<li>Mythological Figures</li>
<li>Religious Supernatural Figures</li>
<li>Literary fictional figures</li>
<li>And so on… this list is very large.</li>
<li>History creates some issues here since older figures might have so
few details, that real figures may appear much like mythological
figures. At the moment, the solution appears to be to pay less and less
attention, as historical things have less detail, and approach in
appearance works of fiction. For example, the biography of Charlemagne
by Notker the Stammerer can be considered fiction by analogies found in
characteristics to other fictions. The biography of Charlemagne by
Einhard, however, can be trusted as historical. If the story of Einhard
were lost, along with other works about Charlemagne, such that all we
have is the life of Charlemagne by Notker the Stammerer, 10,000 years
from now, then we have lost Charlemagne, in the same way that we lost
Pythagoras. This should not come as a shock. Once all information about
a person is lost, they are forgotten. This has happened to nearly
everyone in history.
<ul>
<li>The key criteria here is analogy of properties of the story to
fictional accounts versus realistic biographical accounts. Sometimes
this can be complex, but usually even children can notice differences
between real and fictional accounts. Once I recognized that Santa Clause
was not real, the parallels with works of fiction were obvious and there
is no reason to give it any consideration as real ever again.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Harry Potter
<ul>
<li>The author of this book would not want you to believe Harry Potter
is real. The intent of the author has importance too, because some will
try to “sell” false stories, and this intention of the author can lead
to very long false paths, where people have to work hard to finally
determine that the stories are more similar to fictions than they are to
real accounts.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Santa Clause
<ul>
<li>Consider how additional details are dreamt up, and the story is
locked in history by the original thinkers and marketers who invented
it.</li>
<li>Also notice how people try to sell “Santa Clause” as real to
children, thus making it more difficult for people to come to realize
that it is more like fictional accounts than real accounts.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Based on the Santa Clause example, you should be able to come up
with others, since the intent of the author to “sell” a fictionalized or
semi-fictionalized account more seriously than Santa, has resulted in
people being confused their entire lives. People come to believe in
native cosmologies and so forth for their entire lives, so this is not
unfamiliar, and anthropologists can give many examples. Anthropologists
of the future will list out for us what at present we believe that is
totally false, but was confused for truth because people sold it as
true. The most convincing false stories were those designed for sale
from the very beginning.
<ul>
<li>Example: The life story of L. Ron Hubbard as presented in his video
“An Introduction to Scientology.” There is a pamphlet that comes with
the video describing feats of his that he did not perform. He is the
founder of Scientology, and a <em>writer of fiction</em>. For example,
it is claimed he was the first to be deployed at a battle in WWII, and
there were other “he was the first” claims that were certainly
absurd…</li>
